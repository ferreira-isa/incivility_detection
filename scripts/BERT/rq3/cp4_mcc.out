Some weights of the model checkpoint at bert-base-uncased were not used when initializing BertForSequenceClassification: ['cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'cls.predictions.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.decoder.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at bert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

-----
Original test dataset:

TEXT
1 :  Can you give indications on where the changes should happen and other indications? 

2 :  I am a bit lost in the source code 

3 :  My sincere apologies if I missed something. 

4 :  If I sound hostile, it because I am kindly sharing the user hostility you're unleashing on developers trying to get work done. 

5 :  I don't know anything about gclient or gyp, and I didn't see any documentation in the repo to lead me in the right direction (except the README, which tells me I should be looking in tools/). 

6 :  I'm afraid that without guidance/help I won't be able to move far with the port. 

7 :  I'm also having huge issues with building NSPR similarly to what was reported in comment #&#173,7 over an year ago. 

8 :  I would like to help .. just don't think I have the needed skills. 

9 :  Unfortunately since then work has been busy which left no time for further dart work. 

10 :  It's quite sad that not all of the interested parties were invited to the table. 

11 :  I understand your frustration at the delay in getting this in. 

12 :  It is possible that moving the files to third_party is not ideal but it does provide us a clean separation of the hosts that the Dart team ships periodically as install ready binaries in a SDK vs other hosts. 

13 :  If you have other ideas on how we can maintain this separation I am willing to listen. 

14 :  I had plans to make a proper port (with separate files and not patches on the linux ones) but after seeing how the Dart team treated the BSD ports efforts and specially Mulander's work ... I really got disappointed and lost all interest in Dart! 

15 :  I've likewise abandoned Dart because I see nothing in the Dart project to give me confidence that it will be ported. 

16 :  I'm willing to give it another look if things change, but I can't use something if it doesn't support the systems I deploy on. 

17 :  This would really help modularizing our code 

18 :  The lack of communication on one of, if not the most requested feature of the last 3-4 years is not something to appreciate. 

19 :  They decided to implement it which is great news, crass comments like these do not help anyone. 

20 :  apologise if you felt somehow attacked by my comment. 

21 :  Lose more games than the Jets and act like you are a team full of Tom Bradys. 

22 :  It would be great if aside from the current way of building widgets you could add JSX like capabilities. 

23 :  Sorry if I sound defensive or aggressive. :-) 

24 :  don't take my argumentative tone as dismissive, I'm very interested in your input here. 

25 :  Stop nit-picking things that are not fully specified. 

26 :  Make Flutter look familiar to React developers and you have a chance of attracting a bunch of new users to Flutter. 

27 :  Wow, could have written a blog post xD 

28 :  The point being, we haven't made any decisions yet, and are very open to learning what needs to be done based on all these discussions and experiments. 

29 :  That I appreciate and I read all your 'long writings', answering everything: no way, but when I answer properly you don't understand my answer and concludes that I am being dismissive. 

30 :  And if, by chance, he was being sincere, then I apologize for my snideness 

31 :  We are very interested to better understand your scenarios where WCF server side functionality is required. 

32 :  I have dreamed for years of having WCF across their entire network so that I can finally (!) have reliable transactions and durable services spanning their various generations of Linux and Windows. 

33 :  Having WCF on .Net core is not only desirable, it is essential. 

34 :  We have a strong need to run .NET/WCF on Linux, so please add this to the road map! 

35 :  Stop invest in dead technologies such as WCF and VB.NET, spending tremendous amounts of resources to nowhere, instead of spending for something good. 

36 :  Without WCF we will either have to abandon a lot of the plans or suffer a decrease in productivity.  :-( 

37 :  It's possible you misunderstood the comment. 

38 :  Do I like being productive, absolutely. That means, never using WCF. 

39 :  The code has been already updated, but `7.19.0` did not include this. :( 

40 :  it seems you're a little too caffeinated here : 

41 :  Mike you are a valued JIT contributor 

42 :  I didn't really think about it too much. 

43 :  I didn't really think about it too much.  I was just trying to keep things peaceful here. 

44 :  I honestly believe that his harsh remarks were not intentional. 

45 :  It would be a great loss for the .NET community if you'd stop contributing. 

46 :  If you consider my comment to be negative, just tell me and I'll happily remove it. 

47 :  I did not contribute to get praise, I only contributed for the fun of it. And it stops being fun if I have to deal with nonsense. 

48 :  I can very much relate to that. 

49 :  But we need to be careful that we don't use valuable contributions as a currency to offset disrespectful behavior. 

50 :  Let's just say that it is distasteful. 

51 :  I honestly don't follow any more 

52 :  Sorry to hear that, but what is causing here an issue for you? 

53 :  It supposed to be a discussion so you can ask questions too. 

54 :  Then I quickly deleted it, as I recognized that it was not a helpful reaction and wouldn't help advance the conversation. 

55 :  So excuse me if this is how you felt. 

56 :  Seriously, have I done something to you? 

57 :  I encourage everyone to report this package to npm as its breaking their rules and harmful for npm ecosystem and its attacking users computer. 

58 :  Report it to npm 

59 :  Stop taking money for something that should be free and open. 

60 :  I hope that there is a more reasonable way of asking for funding since this practice will encourage many other projects to do the same and it would be unfortunate for our terminal output logs to look like nascar advertisements after everyone starts doing the same thing, which starts looking like the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). 

61 :  It is sad that so many with such strong opinions have no contributions in the last year outside of this issue. 

62 :  I don't want to have to view advertisements in my CI logs, and I hate what this would mean if other packages started doing this. 

63 :  I didn't mean to suggest that anyone disagreeing was acting as part of a mob. It was meant to apply specifically to those people treating a github issue like it's a place for trolling, nasty comments, etc. My apologies if it came off that way. 

64 :  Just be decent and follow the community's rules. 

65 :  If you are going to rant, go to twitter. 

66 :  Hopefully someone more well versed in this domain can help figure out what is going on. 

67 :  In the end, would be nice if these errors were caught and the users were notified of the GUI of what actions might be needed. 

68 :  Let's all be respectful. 

69 :  Take your foul mouthed trolling to Twitter. 

70 :  Find one that you are satisfied with and use it. 

71 :  Grow up and move along. 

72 :  I hate that these things never actually get fixed or resolved 

73 :  We're having a real problem with this because ESLint ignores the .eslintrc.json file (due to some other bug in ESLint), and it breaks the build. 

74 :  I understand you're upset and this rule is causing problems for you. 

75 :  I've found that it helps to clearly describe the problem I'm encountering and propose some solutions or ask questions to understand the problem space better. 

76 :  I empathize with your frustration 

77 :  Life is too short 

78 :  And the worst part is that I feel helpless to improve the situation. I vote, I campaign, I phone bank, I donate, I protest, I write to officials, I try to inform others... and yet things just keep getting worse and worse. 

79 :  Adding your political beliefs to your licensing is petty. The irony is that this very project is hosted on a resource owned by Microsoft... 

80 :  I'm not as familiar with the react code base (clearly from my comments) but if there's anything you need help on to get this going let me know 

81 :  They haven't commented on any of the related issues and they've been open for months. 

82 :   @_ing from the react team to get some on this? Seems to be quite a lot of interest, but not a single issue on this topic has received a comment from a maintainer in 5 months. 

83 :  Just wanted to chime in and say I strongly feel the same way - it would be at least good to get a hey we won't be considering this"." 

84 :  I know this wasn't your intention 

85 :  I'm really feeling stupid for not being able to figure this one out :( 

86 :  Though I am confident that my analysis is decent enough, much of the code I was referencing was unfamiliar/new to me. 

87 :  I'm not experienced that, but I'll use it for a while to see what happens. 

88 :  If I'm misunderstanding what is being requested here, please let me know. 

89 :  And this whole text could be avoided if you guys simple had said:  yeah that was a bad idea, i will try to put your suggestion in a next changelog or add some tool to convert json/xml then json/plist and any other technology RC lays on"" 

90 :  It would be nice to have shift+insert or Ctrl+shift+insert to have a linux like feeling or ctrl+shift+c and ctrl+shift+v like powershell does 

91 :  I apologise if I've misread any of the code. 

92 :  feel free to point out what I said that was even remotely an attack on *anyone* or an assumption of motivations? 

93 :  I shouldn't have even posted the above, but I couldn't resist throwing my two cents in - sorry! 

94 :  I worry about the racial discrimination have happened in US from long time ago to recent as a human being, while I also insist to regard `blacklist, whitelist, blackbox testing, whitebox testing, master, slave, etc` to be neutral nouns in `IT area` as a software engineer. 

95 :  Indeed, that shows my attitude about racial discrimination and mercy about people who suffer from brutality all around the world. 

96 :  Don't let word game anesthetize us, If everyone pays attention, discrimination will slowly disappear, but if we pretend that it has disappeared now, it may exist forever, The more one tries to hide, the more one is exposed. 

97 :  Whatever your strategic decision for Godot is, it's totally legit. I'm here only to defend bgfx from false statements. 

98 :  Imploring maintainers of an open source software is not going to yield the best results, I think. 

99 :  Don't forget about those instagals! :dancer: 

100 :  stop trying to read the motivations of someone you don't know. 

101 :  I'm happy to keep the discussion going, so don't take this as a negative sign. 

102 :  Follow the steps and put this script tag in the head tag. I'm not sure what else Yandex needs, but this is generally how google adsense works. 

103 :  we want to also be kind in how we request help from the core maintainers of Gatsby. 

104 :  Try to push the cause in Seattle ,) 

105 :  there is a lot of politics behind all these huge software/hardware infrastructures... :-( 

106 :  By soon", do you mean before ______? ( _insert funny sarcasm here_ )." 

107 :  I do hope they are working on a hip backend, not a full fork. That would be sad and only split the working effort. 

108 :  Sorry if the above came out sounding rude, just trying to clarify my position above! 

109 :  This is not Twitter or your Facebook wall... :-) 

110 :  I'm very sad about the abandon of GPU support for macOS. 

111 :  Using GPU acceleration locally on my MacBook Pro or future iMac Pro would be awesome. 

112 :  (yeah, the syntax looks like some sort of incantations or something ,-)) 

113 :  Sorry, nevermind. I made a mess out of it :D. My config was not in order, 

114 :  I'm not a Webpack guru myself 

115 :  So many different solutions, so many different workable options, yet none of them helped me in the past 3 hours getting bootstrap up and running... 

116 :  stop wasting our time. 

117 :  This is the worst framework i have ever seen. 

118 :  I have real project with Angular, and the only thing i get while developing - is the hurting. Tons of hurt i get. 

119 :  when you deal with real big scale project - the hurt is the only thing you get. 

120 :  Go home 

121 :  Let's not make the person who runs a massive open source project almost by himself job harder than it needs to be 

122 :  I read you... I am a Software Engineer, I am that senior level guy you speak of... I have cried out Angular pains in the past. 

123 :  So, sorry I don't have small debate points and I don't blame you for having your point of view. 

124 :  I feel your points. They burn us, too. 

125 :  My hope is that the team gets back to productive boosting features as soon as the dirty plumbing is done. And no need for another major rewrite (Router4?) 

126 :  I hope in the future Angular will become even better and easier to understand. 

127 :  I will step away and unfollow understanding how my mouth often gets me in trouble. 

128 :  make sure that even if using `vh`/`vw` etc, that there's a component for font sizing tied to something else like `px`/`rem`/`em`. 

129 :  I am really sorry if I break any rules. 

130 :  I'm struggling about passive reaction of Flutter team. 

131 :  feel misled because everything I first saw on homepage etc, promised 60 FPS and native performance. I think its bordering on unethical to not make this problem clearly known to new developers. 

132 :  I wish it was paid so we would not get the its free, whatever you get be happy response. 

133 :  At least we would not get a 100 line code commit after 1 year on such a huge issue. 

134 :  So there's nothing concrete that's being done yet? 

135 :  Are there really users that like to keep tabs only on specific parts, like indent? 

136 :  I'd like to voice my displeasure towards two trends going on in Visual Studio editor since VS 2015 

137 :  Finally, I'd appreciate if there was some workaround for this spaces instead of tabs issue, it's driving me nuts. 

138 :  Shouldn't the above satisfy everyone involved? 

139 :  Maybe that is somehow my fault because English is not my primary language and what I wrote is hard to understand, but in all honesty I am not sure what are you arguing for (or against). 

140 :  I am really surprised to hear that something like that cannot be done while still keeping all current options. 

141 :  I'm happy to clarify any of my points. 

142 :  If you'd like another venue to discuss things (perhaps in realtime) I'm also happy to use gitter or discord to continue the discussion :) 

143 :  it may be what you want, but it may be wrong for other users complaining about something similar. 

144 :  I certain see how it can be a bug. 

145 :  Unfortunately though, we've now had this new system a long time, and we are wary about subjecting people to more potential changes in behavior, esp. as it might fix this issue, only to cause problems for others :-/ 

146 :  I don't disagree with that, but there seems to be great resistance to even acknowlege that the behaviour has changed at some point, and that it doesn't seem correct, from a users point of view, that selecting **Always keep TABs** means **Always keep TABs except sometimes they will be changed to spaces** 

147 :  I don't disagree with that, 

148 :  If i've missed any points, i apologize. 

149 :  There's a lot being discussed here, and i likely missed it. 

150 :  I totally get that that can be frustrating. 

151 :  A group of people (that you are not a part of) is having their needs met, while yours are not. 

152 :  However, this really is a space where potential changes risk very bad outcomes for many groups. 

153 :  Again, I'm happy to help clarify any of my statements, or address any points i may have missed. 

154 :  I apologize for being rude 

155 :  At this point I am discouraged to report more because nothing ever seems to get fixed (usually because it's complicated")." 

156 :  I hope you prove me wrong and actually fix this issue, but I won't be holding my breath. 

157 :  I apologize in advance for the offtopic 

158 :  It is, lets say, disappointing that it sounds like Microsoft can't maintain it's code because it is too complex. 

159 :  If you just told me that this shouldn't be addressed because I was a nobody and my opinion wasn't important, I'd be annoyed, certainly, but overall less concerned. 

160 :  change the example 

161 :  give keybox to me now 

162 :  roll your own, pick another technology, or pay the bill. 

163 :  This makes it harder for newcomers to learn aspnet core without the support from the community or microsoft officially 

164 :  If you want to give us feedback on the pricing and explain your situation, this is not the right place to do that. 

165 :  I completely get that the IS devs neeed more money and want to be paid. 

166 :  I'm disappointed that such a basic functionality now requires lots of unplanned work and time. 

167 :  That's really sad. 

168 :  I'm not the guy who can actually judge what you're doing and why 

169 :  somehow like the whole OpenSource-Idea, no? ,) 

170 :  One must learn to pick his fights, so to speak. :) 

171 :  I'm sorry for any distress this experience has caused you. 

172 :  This feature should not be default, this should remain optional until all supported browsers handle it. 

173 :  please correct me if my assumption was incorrect 

174 :  I believe that, in this case, inclusive" means ~"how welcome someone ***feels*** in the angular community." The poster is _telling us_ that, in at least one case, someone doesn't feel like the angular community is inclusive." 

175 :  It also makes clear that, as a community, we do care about how welcome people feel and our issue is not with the _intent_ of the original post (to be more inclusive and thoughtful), but rather the execution. 

176 :  this seems to boil down to what percentage of the community/potential community might interpret `ng` as a slur."" 

177 :  bolster their suggestion by providing more examples or reasons why the interpretation the girl had is actually generally applicable. 

178 :  If I were evaluating this issue, I wouldn't care how many people interpret `ng-repeat` the way I intended, I'm interested in how many people interpret `ng-repeat` the way I *didn't* intend. 

179 :  Because of this, this issue strikes me as providing valuable feedback and I would encourage people to surface similar experiences that they may have had. 

180 :  I'm sorry to hear about your experience and I understand the sensitivity of your concern. 

181 :  Let us take some time to consider your request and respond in a mindful way. 

182 :  It was never our intention 

183 :  we will be very mindful of this problem when creating future APIs 

184 :  We the Angular team, strongly believe in building an inclusive community where everyone feels welcome, and we see how especially ng-repeat could be problematic in certain scenarios. 

185 :  Did you dislike the idea of solving it via a tickable option in the Options window? 

186 :  If the idea of putting it in the Options window is rejected, then I'm trying to brainstorm an alternative solution 

187 :  I personally don't feel like it's worth fixing myself, but i'd be happy to help you with a PR to change if it is something that is affecting you. 

188 :  Two minds being better than one and all that :) 

189 :  If that changes in the future, let me know. 

190 :  My offers of assistance seem to not be welcome 

191 :  It'd be great if a future version of Windows Terminal baked this in by default across all shells - it's really useful to have 

192 :  You can squint and imagine a merged feature that serves all the scenarios. 

193 :  It is very disappointed 

194 :  I've started thinking that Microsoft consider community opinion ... I am very disappointed 

195 :  I think to make right decision for this feature is to create a poll and ask people will they use this feature and would not be it annoying that exist two solutions: static methods and free functions ... 

196 :  And that's also normal that people who against it would like to have more acceptable reasoning or possibility of rethinking 

197 :  when I say stop with ... I really mean that _we're the ones responsible, at the end of the day._ Sorry about that, it sounded bad on a re-read. 

198 :  a few people have been asking me today about pip install 32 bit tensorflow support. 

199 :  Having the same problem here. Would really appreciate a fix 

200 :  then I am going to stop supporting Tensoeflow. 

201 :  We would appreciate a python 32bit fix, some distros install python 32 bit by default and there's no way around it 

202 :  A lot of my clients asking for this too. would appreciate a fix 

203 :  another one just asked me for a fix -_- 

204 :  more people have asked me private for a fix today 

205 :  Don't underestimate how difficult things like this are from a theoretical perspective. 

206 :  Lots of people here manage to be constructive and positive and I'd appreciate your effort in not starting fights with us or other contributors. 

207 :  Go and learn some manners! 

208 :  I've read about observable something, but why would I use the whole framework if I had to use another framework and do my own implementation? 

209 :  If they make fool of me it's not my fault 

210 :  So this means the whole framework is unpolished, untested and lazy coded. 

211 :  clearly you are feeling frustrated and angry right now. I can understand how that can happen. 

212 :  It is important that we work constructively to solve our problems and not resort to insults. 

213 :  I'm very sorry if this will cause you to leave Godot. 

214 :  I understand that some black people may not consider these terms offensive, but I would rather someone not want to work with me because they think I am too politically correct than because they think I am too insensitive and blind. 

215 :  Of course, if you @trivikr personally feel strongly about this then I support you :] 

216 :  If there's another way for this to work, I'm open to alternate ideas, but I think conditionally playbook imports would be generically useful. 

217 :  Please use the‘  button to let the maintainers know you need this feature. Getting a ton of emails from these +1s. 

218 :  I think you have a legitimate concern and I'm sorry if you feel like I'm ignoring you. 

219 :  I think you have a legitimate concern and I'm sorry if you feel like I'm ignoring you. 

220 :  do not you think that simply stating that I 'messed up writers" ' without explaining why is rude?" 

221 :  Look again, the name isn't Maui, the name is Multi-platform App UI which abbreviates to M.A.U.I. 

222 :  I hope this is not Microsoft's general attitude towards open source projects these days... 

223 :  bro I am an Open Source author and maintainer so don't try lecturing me about being against off-putting towards the open-source community"" 

224 :  That's not because others really love .NET, but because they try to stay constructive here. 

225 :  MauiKit whether you want to hear it or not has no fundamentals of what I as an Open Source Author and Maintainer would consider signs of a healthy project. 

226 :  We are talking about open source projects, there should be a common philosophy, not a competition for those who have the biggest issue counter. 

227 :  Sorry if I sounded harsh, that wasn't my intent. 

228 :  To be honest, this entire thread so far makes me far less inclined to introduce a dependency on the enterprise project. 

229 :  will have to move to a real open source tool like JMeter instead of gatling.  Sad. 

230 :  We are really sorry to hear this. 

231 :  Don't be so agitated 

232 :  For best outcome please consider writing your messages mindfully and calmly explaining both your problem and what is the suggested resolution or expectation for it. 

233 :  My sincere apologies.  I was in the wrong, and I've done you harm.  I'm sorry. 

234 :  Alex, sorry, I had gathered that you're recognized as the principle Windows maintainer. I didn't mean to invent a title. 

235 :  Well, I'm sorry for having been slightly edgy due to the total irrelevance of that statement with which he accompanies the news that he unblocked me. 

236 :  Let's be clear - you're telling *me* that I don't credit trade-offs or drawbacks, on a project I maintain, for a protocol that was designed a year ago, and for which noone has reported any automated breakage of any system, while still being able to migrate at the time of their choice. 

237 :  It's also been frustrating to be treated as a troll when I was called entitled but responded with a compliment. 

238 :  It was frustrating to see my point be misinterpreted as something else. 

239 :  I'm sorry if you felt your concern wasn't taken into consideration, I think it's simply because you believe, as you said, making future decisions based on trust is a mistake", while other people may not (I don't)." 

240 :  Think about that. 

241 :  I read some thoughtful and reasonable responses in this thread, and I understand how everyone has their point of view. 

242 :  Stop whining about that and remove the BLM from the site. 

243 :  grow some thicker skin and calm down. 

244 :  As a side note, the kind of errors hit by the users on the thread of this issue (lack of basic knowledge of Python for instance) tells me that we cannot solve their problem. 

245 :  He, being one of the top contributors to scikit-learn has to make tough decisions as to what will go into our codebase and what will not, as a more verbose documentation or tutorial might not be preferable for a lot of people. 

246 :  we understand your eagerness to solve your problem, and your frustration when it is not solved. 

247 :  I am very new in scikit-learn. 

248 :  I will be highly appreciated any useful advice. 

249 :  Sorry if this issue seems a bit salty, but it's really annoying 

250 :  I just lost hours worth of state because of this behavior. 

251 :  Just having automatic updates install upon next launch would be a perfectly fine behavior 

252 :  Unfortunately I am going to have to abandon it until this issue is fixed because I'm losing a lot of time and work every other week when an update is pushed and my long-running processes are lost. 

253 :  Don't act on theories! 

254 :  This is the second or third time I've been screwed over by Microsoft's shitty installation practices. 

255 :  The grass isn't greener on the other side... 

256 :  To be fair, @jeremylt, the 300hrs estimate was quite demotivating for me when I started. 

257 :  I don't believe anything I've said could fairly be labeled mansplaining, but I am sorry that I was curt 

258 :  This mistake is still haunting us years later, unfortunately. 

259 :  It's sad that I have to use such a long winded approach to try and defend its future and get certain parts of Microsoft to cooperate with other parts. 

260 :  Replace the template text and remove irrelevant text as the instruction says. 

261 :  I think it is more important that the main developer of Vim can concentrate on enhancing and improving Vim instead of having to change a workflow, that has been proven to be working well for the past 30 years. 

262 :  My words were met by defensiveness, ego, stubbornness, ignorance, and delusion. 

263 :  Starting a reply with the conversation is already over is not okay. 

264 :  Check out the web service to see how they want you to do it. If it's your own server, set it up properly. 

265 :  Make up your mind, updater… 

266 :  Have patience 

267 :  doesn't hurt to be polite. 

268 :  fork it, fix it, make a pull request and contribute. 

269 :  It seems here that Microsoft is taking an active approach to kill VB actively (as opposed to passive approach - just let it die by abandoning it). :-( 

270 :  I probably shouldn't make any more PR as they will fail. 

271 :  I feel my time creating that PR was wasted, so not rewarding, hence I'll think twice before making another PR. 

272 :  I feel my time creating that PR was wasted, so not rewarding, hence I'll think twice before making another PR. 

273 :  I'm sorry I don't have much time for other things beside work and family. 

274 :  I didn't realize a 4 line PR would pull me into a discussion on how to improve it by implementing a new code base and consequently figure why shippable would fail. 

275 :  I didn't realize a 4 line PR would pull me into a discussion on how to improve it by implementing a new code base and consequently figure why shippable would fail. 

276 :  Feel free do whatever you see fit, I'm off to other things, good luck & sorry for the noise. 

277 :  Feel free do whatever you see fit, I'm off to other things, good luck & sorry for the noise. 

278 :  I think it really has to do with time of day, traffic, alignment of the planets, etc. 

279 :  Sooooooooooooooo slowly :( 

280 :  My apologies for the frustration this issue has caused. 

281 :  It would be helpful if you could benchmark this with curl for reference. 

282 :  i wish Salt guys put the comments inside this source, listing all the bugs related to this module. 

283 :  i made quite many changes in that mounts.py - and now i am thinking about undoing almost all of them... Lack of any documentation... 

284 :  See... i know very little about Linux and nothing about Python, so i was googling everything i could think of :-) 

285 :  it is sad how fast you were to say Salt is all wrong and how protective you fet about OMV. 

286 :  Our customers have complained after opening the application for the first time :( 

287 :  Disappointing that this is not being considered high priority. 

288 :  Honestly, this issue made me re-consider of cross-platform frameworks being owned by the same company (Google here) will be supported at best, and ignoring quality metrics delivery on other platforms (iOS). 

289 :  The project needs lifesaving measures as it's community is dissatisfied enough to be discussing forks. 

290 :  Issues where opened and closed by the bot without any reponse, and nobody but you can do some critical things (merging pull requests, publishing fixes...). 

291 :  I hope people keep that vision in mind, when considering the near-term goals like providing prompt feedback directly on GitHub discussions, quick resolution for user-contributed PRs, maintenance releases etc. 

292 :  I do continue to feel pretty disappointed that the active project ownership that is so badly is still not coming in the near term. 

293 :  I agree your mind but really sad about results...  :-| 

294 :  PS : sorry for my poor english, frenchies are really bad with it :-) 

295 :  I love you Jack, for making SUI. I just hope you dont get crazy <3 

296 :  At the same time I must mention one thing: **you will not succeed on your own**. 

297 :  In that regard I find it highly confusing - and disrespectful imho - that you chose to ignore all suggestions to delegate power to trusted contributors who would like to help you to maintain SUI 2.x. 

298 :  PS: You will still be the captain ,) 

299 :  If you're just going to hack around with low level packets, then just use netty and don't bother us when things break. 

300 :  I understand that it won't be accepted, I'm not contesting that. 

301 :  be kind 

302 :  As a consumer of your product, I expect it to work as advertised 

303 :  So our apologies if some things take too long, or don't end up happening 

304 :  but it's wrong to blame the maintainers for this. 

305 :  Well I'm having trouble making a reproducer for this. 

306 :  it would be great if there was a built-in way to paginate a list Jekyll collection items on a page. 

307 :  it would be nice if there was a built in pagniation that worked for both post and collection items. 

308 :  would like to see Nested Collections. 

309 :  I would like to see [reading metadata in separate files] 

310 :  I would like to see the tags of collections included in site.tags. 

311 :  build in support for content blocks and components 

312 :  I'd very much love to have native support for Coffeescript in much the same manner as Sass. 

313 :  it would be great to have more interactions with github, like pulling profile information (contributions, avatar, ), releases data - and convert it for proper publication. 

314 :  I would like to see an automated tool like Webpack integrated into Jekyll to handle Sass and Javascript. 

315 :  I'd love to see Docker volume mounts work with Jekyll and Docker for Windows. 

316 :  I would love to see an offically supported page generator from data files. 

317 :  Make internal linking easier. 

318 :  Dont work with fb and google 

319 :  This is not the level of security awareness I expect Microsoft to have. 

320 :  work with your security teams to get the uploader qualified by at least the major vendors 

321 :  A company that does not understand the need of a full doc do not will offer a serious support in the long time 

322 :  Close this issue 

323 :  It would be nice to at least give an explanation before just closing an issue, this way nothing will get resolved, 

324 :  It would be nice to at least give an explanation before just closing an issue, this way nothing will get resolved, 

325 :  Wondering if Terminal users are mentally prepared to such amount of social activity in their lives.. switching from 0 social life to this directly might be... Overwhelming 

326 :  It's a fun-take and I wanted to upvote it for the fun part, but then I thought it may send the wrong message so I had to downvote it, just to not confuse newcomers. ,) 

327 :  The removal of the santa hat, and kowtowing to a fake user, is incredibly offensive to me. 

328 :  When I updated my VSCode, it was gone. 

329 :  If you don't do it I'll feel sad and disappointed. 

330 :  I'm deeply sorry for my insensitivity. 

331 :  Bring back the Santa's hat! 

332 :  I liked the santa hat, it brought a little joy to my day. Very sad that it has been removed. 

333 :  bring the hat back 

334 :  Bring back the hat. 

335 :  Put a satan hat back. 

336 :  add a Satan Hat! 

337 :  Assuming he was trolling: troll successful, gg 

338 :  I'm also not happy that the santa hat was removed, completely ignoring the public opinion here on GH. 

339 :  I def understand how frustrated you are, but every new platform has its shares of issues and stability. 

340 :  I understand you're frustrated, but having a positive attitude, even when you're stressed out or frustrated speaks volumes to others who are genuinely trying to help. 

341 :  Instead, when are you going to add REAL support for streaming?? 

342 :  I'm almost 40, and I bet I'm gonna die BEFORE you even get the idea to implement all of this!!! Pfffff............... 

343 :  that is painful 

344 :  Embrace the patterns of the npm ecosystem. 

345 :  Could you show me how to resolve this issue please? 

346 :  fork lerna and do it yourself. 

347 :  what a waste of time. 

348 :  We are talking things technically, don't make it personal. 

349 :  Calm down 

350 :  If you feel disrespect on nasty", I apologize." 

351 :  I think, you have many professional developers and why this F... RTL problem is not important for you? 

352 :  Why atom team don't like to fix this issue? 

353 :  Microsoft products are phenomenally bad and it's a wonder how you guys still stay in business. 

354 :  I suspect your whiteboarding hiring technique is ineffective and counterproductive. 

355 :  What's so special about installing .NET Core that it requires a different installation strategy? 

356 :  WTF? 

357 :  GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER MICROSOFT!!!! 

358 :  If I sound harsh, it's because I am sick and tired of Microsoft releasing half-baked products that don't work as expected. 

359 :  I would feel sorry for you guys like I would for the slow kid who klutzes around the basketball court, but this isn't your first time on the court with years of effort and tons of resources. 

360 :  It's why your own developers are using MacBook Pros for development. 

361 :  Telling us you are frustrated is fine, ranting is not. 

362 :  This is the kind of coding quality we get when corporations prioritizes employee diversity over code quality 

363 :  A thumbs down isn't enough on this one. There's zero tolerance for backwater attitude. Reporting. 

364 :  If people like me and you don't attempt it then we can wait another 3 years without anyone else picking the issue up. 

365 :  I am frankly fed up with this posture in open source projects. 

366 :  I've abandoned (a long time ago) the port effort and don't even use Dart anymore and will stop watching this rep. 

367 :  Why would I post this on the community site? I'm experiencing this problem on the travis-ci.com website?? 

368 :  you are showing how unappreciative and ignorant you can be. 

369 :  You can fault the devs for not getting this right with modules from the start, but aside from that, you should have more awareness of reality and what these changes have required before sharing those types of crass comments. 

370 :  In fact, you should probably not use any open source software, as the type of comment you left above are one of the major reasons why application developers give up on open source. 

371 :  Just because the software is open source doesn't mean we aren't paying for it. 

372 :  I honestly cannot believe how casual and dismissive you guys at MS are. 

373 :  I understand it must really difficult to do your job as a $1.75T company but can you try? 

374 :  Seeing you are happy to close issues and never respond to replies in closed issues, I am forced to open new issue. 

375 :  I would like to remind you that we are a small team of maintainers, and it has been less than or barely 24 hours since I responded to your issue yesterday. 

376 :  Telling users that they can use DSX but can't use debugger or enjoy auto-complete is a non starter for me. 

377 :  you are mixing everything I say and this conversation is going nowhere. In legal terms you are Badgering the witness"." 

378 :  I just don't have the time for this here. 

379 :  You failed to grasp that XML parsing (with some extra code to skip '{}' properly) is orders of magnitude simpler than fully parsing a programming language like Dart. 

380 :  you should invest you time and energy in writing up convincing arguments. 

381 :  You guys are suffering from NIH syndrome (Not-invented-here). Good artists copy, great artists steal", mediocre artists, well, behave like you." 

382 :  Really !!! nobody seems to bother to explain what exactly Flutter would gain... blah blah blah"." 

383 :  I don't want to argue against the feature but comments like if you don't do x then horribly y will happen" are just ridiculous." 

384 :  I think you underestimate how willing people are to try things, even when they're not fully polished. 

385 :  Obviously you didn't take my hint on length to heart but don't come to conclusions about my character because you don't know me at all. 

386 :  It is obvious to me that you are not very experienced with JSX, you really don't understand how it works. 

387 :  You are not the meter used to measure success and you don't know what I am up to. 

388 :  You equate me not having much experience with JSX and me not knowing how it works at all? 

389 :  my point still stands - that kind of comment is _still_ not appropriate here. 

390 :  Women can also be a construction worker  

391 :  This is the worst piece of advice anyone can give. 

392 :  Are you a I am the greatest dev alive" guy?" 

393 :  because if you even pause for a second to contemplate yes to any of those things you have a very rude awakening coming. 

394 :  It would also have been nice if you gave some actual reasoning behind your comment, not just flaming. 

395 :  I think I would rather become a rice farmer than ever touch WCF again. 

396 :  This is another good reason to not support WCF. Years of people implementing designs using WCF based on false assumptions or mythical functionality. 

397 :  If you don't like it, don't use it!!! 

398 :  Why try and stop others from using it? and most importantly why do so with absolutely no information just flaming? sorry but show me, tell me why? 

399 :  So, if this way of doing things is so terrible tell me why, don't just talk smack. Facts, Proof, Scientific Method... 

400 :  **I ask kindly post something informative and factual or just stop trolling.** 

401 :  Berating them to move to REST when it's impossible for them is neither clever nor helpful. 

402 :  This was last discussed more than five years ago and should be discussed again. 

403 :  for support reasons, you don't really have to ask what platform they're on, just mention the three paths in one sentence, it's actually rather easy. 

404 :  You're being a bit facetious. 

405 :  The third silly thing is that you're acting like IPython doesn't have any changes that break some pieces of code or tutorials out there. 

406 :  All in all it makes your comment seem more like irrational stubbornness than actual concerns. 

407 :  There's no need to update all the code and documentation all over the internet", nobody has every done that and never will." 

408 :  Now if it's to criticize the code without proper understanding of the technical and social reason of why it is the way it is, and bring XDG zealotry into the mix, I'm even less likely to make an effort. 

409 :  Also, your explanation still makes zero sense It's just re-identify the id if change" isn't even a proper sentence." 

410 :  Listen to his comment and stop suggesting this crudely thought-up bandaid of a fix"." 

411 :  Just PLEASE STOP. 

412 :  Care to explain why did you deleted my comment? 

413 :  Because it was completely inappropriate. Telling other contributors to not comment because you have no clue what you're talking about" is toxic behavior." 

414 :  Telling other contributors to not comment because you have no clue what you're talking about" is toxic behavior." 

415 :  While your contributions are clearly valuable, you need to accept that you're part of a larger community and need to treat others with respect. 

416 :  As such I don't care about what the code of conduct says because anyway I don't plan to contribute more work to this OSS project. 

417 :  Well, I consider his behavior to show a lack of respect for other's people work and time. 

418 :  Well, I appreciate they're appreciated but at the same time I don't really care. 

419 :  Nobody appreciates random/out of context quoting, straightforward answer avoidance, jumping to conclusions and whatnot. 

420 :  Working for fun doesn't imply that you get to do whatever you want and that there are no consequences. 

421 :  You shield yourself in the code of conduct and go OMG, how could people dare telling me that I'm wrong? 

422 :  Or perhaps you try to do better next time and avoid the not so fun part of messing up? 

423 :  And if you really do not know what you are talking about then what? 

424 :  Instead of an answer I've got some gibberish that tries to pass as code review or whatever that is supposed to be. 

425 :  It's exactly this unwillingness to learn from mistakes that brought us here. 

426 :  Feel free to continue to go down this path, the only thing you'll achieve is to dig the hole deeper. 

427 :  Yet here you are, telling me exactly that. 

428 :  Telling him that he doesn't know what he's talking about is unacceptable. 

429 :  If you want other people to learn, you need to give them more information beyond you're wrong"." 

430 :  You're basically sending him the signal of you're not welcome here"." 

431 :  if we observe behavior like this in the future, we'll ultimately block you. 

432 :  We can't have other contributors stop engaging with us because of your behavior. While your contributions are valued, they don't warrant losing other contributors as collateral damage. 

433 :  But instead of apologizing or even just letting that feedback sink in, you're now trying to turn the tables by saying you got victimized by Tanner because he asked you a technical question and that it's unreasonable from our end to ask you to be respectful in your responses to him. 

434 :  But instead of apologizing or even just letting that feedback sink in, you're now trying to turn the tables by saying you got victimized by Tanner because he asked you a technical question and that it's unreasonable from our end to ask you to be respectful in your responses to him. 

435 :  Oh, you gotta be joking. 

436 :  If you do not follow - can you ask other collaborators for help? 

437 :  Great attitude, especially as a _fastlane_ collaborator. Why not say it in here publicly? 

438 :  So instead of having a discussion and providing a counter example or presenting **any** reasoning why something would not be implemented, you are just discouraging people from helping _fastlane_... 

439 :  This is highly inappropriate. 

440 :  Do you really wonder why I don't want to spend any more time helping you? 

441 :  Mentioning other contributors that have not participated in the discussion is inappropriate as well, by the way. 

442 :  I do not think that looking for help in other contributors was inappropriate in that case as you clearly didn't want to take care of this issue. 

443 :  If people started paying for packages then they would be a lot more careful about the crap they select. 

444 :  YOU choose to spend your time on this project. 

445 :  If you aren't willing to contribute your code or your ideas to open source and aren't willing to contribute to projects monetarily, you should consider tempering your views. 

446 :  You guys seriously don't see what this guy is doing? He's trying to push his ESLint config as a standard" and monetize it." 

447 :  Not when that feedback is 100% predicable because it's nothing but our inner two year old being triggered to whine when everything doesn't go 100% his or her way. 

448 :  To place a copyleft licence on the work and then complain that you can't monetize it because people are copying it for free is an... interesting complaint. 

449 :  What an awful and misleading name for a eslint config. 

450 :  No, not all humans have this reaction.  The reaction you are projecting on all humans infers that all humans are greedy, inconsiderate thieves. 

451 :  Not letting your inner two year old rule you does not mean he is not present.  His complaints are predictable, and those who are voicing complaints from him are not needed. 

452 :  Please take your pseudo-intellectual garbage elsewhere 

453 :  Calling people triggered whining two-year olds doesn't contribute to this discussion constructively. 

454 :  should be ashamed of himself. 

455 :  It would be appreciable and civilized if you stopped calling the other's point of view &mdash, or the point of view you think they hold &mdash, stupid"." 

456 :  It would be appreciable and civilized if you stopped calling the other's point of view &mdash, or the point of view you think they hold &mdash, stupid"." 

457 :  Even worse, you don't seem to try to understand the other side point of view, and rush to your own conclusions. 

458 :  You move from **assumptions**,  **contracts** to **communicating**. 

459 :  Comparisons to Hitler are neither necessary nor welcome here, and anyone unable to debate the merits of *versioning schemes* without relying on that as a rhetorical device should rethink whether their participation here is going to lead to a constructive conversation. 

460 :  Is Microsoft's official answer to reporting a serious performance regression in a subsystem used every day by developers and admins who are managing and maintaining their user base really yeah we are aware of it but whether we will fix it and when, who knows"?" 

461 :  if you're unhappy with how the console is performing, go ahead and switch back to legacy mode. 

462 :  Don't struggle with this, Mike.  Again, if your mythical twenty year old stuff" doesn't work with the new Windows 10 console, by all means, use the old console, link in ANSICON, and keep relying on monkeypatching GetProcAddress (euughhhh)." 

463 :  In other words you want someone else to do the work for you „ 

464 :  You got the report and the working samples. 

465 :  So in your opinion you're free to mess it up, isn't it? 

466 :  Grow up first! 

467 :  Please stop collecting MY data and remove telemetry from all your f**g Windows products. 

468 :  Be thankful. Microsoft uses the data to improve your calculating experience. :smile: 

469 :  Just hoping Microsoft will not put backdoor, telemetry, obfuscation and all its shit in all Github projects, like others did in SourceForge. 

470 :  Just because a product is open-sourced doesn't mean you can go around making demands in this manner. 

471 :  I don't respect people who want to collect my PRIVATE data with software. 

472 :  If you don't like my demand, delete it. 

473 :  If you want better software, delete all these malwares. 

474 :  Because everybody today is speaking on the Net about a Windows Calculator with telemetry inside. I didn't believe even that was possible and... yes. 

475 :  What isn't respectful is polluting the issue-catalog with useless rants, poorly hidden profanity and shouting. 

476 :  I am, however, done with this issue now. 

477 :  you guys are worried about what data the calculator is collecting? what about the rest of windows lol 

478 :  You are not Calculator King of the Internet. 

479 :  A lot of time is being wasted doing what I've already done. 

480 :  The only negative opinions I get are from trolls or people who need an excuse for why they suck at the game. 

481 :  I do NOT need to upgrade, you miss the point. 

482 :  Avoiding Win10 is intentional, because I don't want my PC to have buggy, ugly, spying rubbish. 

483 :  I however suspect your comments are a little disingenuous 

484 :  you are entitled to believe what you like, but Windows 7 is coming to an end, and if you do not wish to remain a Windows user, there is macOS and various forms of Linux, for you to choose from. 

485 :  This isn't some Reddit thread for you to vent. 

486 :  Shortly, it's THE WORST system MS made (after Millenium). 

487 :  That's why I feel disappointed(angry) that you support Win10 and WITHOUT ANY REASON drop support for Win7. 

488 :  And funny, but NOT A SINGLE ANSWER were given by... hm... professionals"." 

489 :  You really need to take a step back and consider how you present yourself publicly. 

490 :  I have no desire to provide a professional response based on your attitude. 

491 :  This is absolutely unacceptable behavior 

492 :  Whoever came up with this idea clearly doesn't understand why ESLint was created in the first place. 

493 :  There are plenty of domains where you would like to give a function a name beginning with use"." 

494 :  You're not paying for it and the maintainers of this tool don't owe you anything. 

495 :  When you do post a complaint, you'll maximize your chances of getting what you want by avoiding incendiary language like absolutely unacceptable", "screaming", "atrocious", "carelessly", and "doesn't understand"." 

496 :  what's fuck google do? flutter is yours,golang is yours, why can't they live together? 

497 :  @akien-mga and other contributors.. get your shit together 

498 :  Whether it was a mistake or not is not decided by you, but the community as a whole. 

499 :  You are not the center of the universe. 

500 :  I have no idea what you are so angry about, just chill man. 

501 :  the only way someone can convince someone else to work on something on this project is good arguments from one side and the will to do it from the other side. 

502 :  you come off as quite hostile. 

503 :  I feel like I've seen you troll (that's what your comments amount to really) other GitHub projects also but I won't bother to check. Life is too short‹» 

504 :  you also completely dodged my point about the smiley emoji implementations. so i recommend a good feature for the engine **(inventory and other 2d stuff, that ALL GAME DEVELOPERS WILL BENEFIT FROM)**, but **you spit in my face**, claim that it's not low level enough", but then go around merging PRs for "emoji smiley" support for fonts? that's somehow still low level though? wtf??" 

505 :  so much for open source"." 

506 :  wtf?? 

507 :  can't have discussions without bypassing  / cheating github it seems! 

508 :  it's really hard for me to sit back and ignore what these companies are doing with my code. 

509 :  I have trouble expressing how angry this makes me feel. 

510 :  Do parents" who drag their children across the desert with the express intent of illegally entering the United States have no share of blame for what happens to these children?" 

511 :  It says nothing about people giving money to e.g. Microsoft or using Microsoft products. 

512 :  Maybe they would have dropped in to tell us it won't be accepted and not to waste any effort on it? 

513 :  go listen to them and stop relying on those soulless motherfuckers at Facebook to give a damn about you. 

514 :  to be honest, this response is borderline unacceptable and I don't even know what to reply. Wow. 

515 :  What the actual hell is your goal here? 

516 :  You're screwing Lerna, not the companies listed 

517 :  Meanwhile you're getting massive community backlash that's only going to continue if you decide to be a child and inappropriately release this as a minor version bump or with the MIT license. 

518 :  The best thing feasible for Lerna at this point is you leaving the project 

519 :  The best thing feasible for Lerna at this point is you leaving the project 

520 :  the second best thing is everyone moving to a fork of the project without a politician having any control. 

521 :  The irony is I 100% agree with your politics, but this is not the place to express them. 

522 :  it sucks if I have to spend my evening checking a bunch of old repos because you'll _maybe_ release this as a patch. 

523 :  So I fucked off and told them to eat shit. 

524 :  Once upon a time I thought I had to go work for those big corporations that I hate in order to do the kind of open source work I want to do. That turned out to be incredibly false. So I fucked off and told them to eat shit. 

525 :  If you want to restrict who can use lerna, then lerna can no longer be called free, it will be proprietary. 

526 :  Calls for civility are perfectly apt after an issue like this. Suggesting that asking people to be nice" is an attempt at ending discussion is one of the strangest stretches I've ever heard. As someone that called maintainers cowards for reverting the changes and removing Jamie, I can get a strong sense of why you'd argue that point, however." 

527 :  do you really want transparency, or are you looking for a fight? 

528 :  If you're looking for rancorous sniping and harmful drama" you might try using a mirror." 

529 :  Explain how me, the person who made the decision, not employed by Microsoft, was secretly paid by Microsoft to ruin open source. Should be an amusing story. 

530 :  So for all this grandstanding you're doing -- why not delete your GitHub account...seriously -- MS will own GitHub soon. Also -- change your OS from Windows -- if you use that... 

531 :  Oh Jesus nevermind -- I'm an idiot I guess :joy: -- apologies :) 

532 :  Sure, I'm sure you could argue Adolf was a pretty cool guy if you ignore all the other stuff he did and just focus on his gun control policy. ”¥ 

533 :  This is really frustrating 

534 :  This is stupid! 

535 :  There is a bug here and posting that this is fixed is misleading. 

536 :  Honest question: does anybody read what I've been posting about this issue? 

537 :  Did you actually read the thread? 

538 :  The problem is nbot the ability to permanently remove files, please the first message of the issue... It's explicit. 

539 :  You assumed the most common error was because `gvfs-trash` was not installed. 

540 :  This thread is the proof it's no more the case. Please, update. 

541 :  I would direct people to actually read the bug report before commenting. 

542 :  Well great let me just ship your computer around so everyone can use it. 

543 :  Or even better we will buy everyone a plane ticket and then can come stand in line to use your computer where the software does work. 

544 :  I dont understand why people working for google have such a problem admting they make mistakes...  everybody does, what makes difference is fix them or not. 

545 :  i cant even imagine a meeting to present the product: Here we have a new tool that will allow developers to set constants remotelly, helping with A/B tests and allowing the developer to change apps behavior without re-deploy." 

546 :  You just told me that if someone has an app in both architectures and want to use the default values THIS PERSON MUST DEFINE EVERY FIELD 3 TIMES... does it sound smart? 

547 :  I hate to be rude and also hate to teach people how to do their jobs. but this architecture design of firebase RC is a clear mistake, anyone with a basic software engineer understand should be able to see that. 

548 :  I'm sorry to tell you but this isnt frustrating" this is a super stupid architecture design..." 

549 :  This is very much a case of Old Microsoft" rearing it's head, rather then new forward looking Microsoft." 

550 :  We can disagree here and have debates, but please halt yourself before assuming the motivations of others and attacking individuals personally or their work. 

551 :  If you're unhappy with them, you're absolutely free to change them. 

552 :  did you perhaps recognise the truth of what I wrote and felt defensive? 

553 :  I am so tempted to chime in with something more confrontational but I don't think it'll add to the debate 

554 :  if you expect it to meet all your needs straight away you probably need to realign your expectations. 

555 :  you're getting a little extreme. 

556 :  Good recommendation, but the you'll sound like Yoda" is too informal for a disclaimer." 

557 :  **I REALLY DISAGREE WITH THIS PR** 

558 :  This is actually nonsensical statement. 

559 :  you are being overly defensive when the whole argument was about Godot, not BGFX. 

560 :  You seem to be assuming that just because of adding BGFX support, everything will be fine and no one will ever have to learn how the underlying APIs work. 

561 :  thanks a lot for your enthusiasm, but I am the one doing the rendering work in Godot, not you. 

562 :  As always with Godot, you are free to make your own renderer with BGFX, show me that it's flawless, has better better performance, works better than mine (of course while supporting the full Godot feature set) and uses less resources and code to prove me wrong.. as well as commiting full time over the next years to maintain it. 

563 :  If you want a revolution, begin with it yourself. 

564 :  If you want to prove your ideas, invest in them because words are free. 

565 :  What a classic example of elitism and douchebaggery. 

566 :  I will stay miles away from Godot and any projects you maintain, thanks. 

567 :  I will stay miles away from Godot and any projects you maintain, thanks. 

568 :  Nobody's saying it shouldn't use the network. 

569 :  It just shouldn't use the network *before the user has given it permission*, because otherwise it is a **data leak**. 

570 :  That's *why the consent dialog exists*. 

571 :  That seems to be a recurring issue 

572 :  You need to reopen this one too, because, inconvenient or not, autoupdate checks are also an inadvertent form of telemetry *whether the project uses them for the purpose or not*. 

573 :  It doesn't matter if the telemetry is coming from the telemetry package" or not." 

574 :  As already stated, if that form of telemetry" is an issue for you feel free to block the network access or create a version of Atom that doesn't check for updates." 

575 :  What about the thousands of other users who haven't spent time and money on things like Little Snitch, who nevertheless don't want to be tracked and explicitly opt out of telemetry that still get telemetry sent (and logged by their government forever) against their wishes? 

576 :  If you're going to insist on the autoupdate thing, couldn't you just do it once per month, at a random number of cumulative hours delay (say, 1-12) after startup, so that it doesn't function as an ad hoc user has launched the app" telemetry event to everyone watching and logging the network?" 

577 :  If you're going to insist on the autoupdate thing, couldn't you just do it once per month, at a random number of cumulative hours delay (say, 1-12) after startup, so that it doesn't function as an ad hoc user has launched the app" telemetry event to everyone watching and logging the network?" 

578 :  As I have stated multiple times you can definitely work with Atom while offline (or with network requests blocked). 

579 :  I do think that while delivered in a dictatorial manner, comment is worth discussing more. 

580 :  Aww.. Here, have a beer on me: :beer: 

581 :  There is also room now to put Google Ads in the exception messages. 

582 :  If you, or somebody else, think Node.js *should* address one of the particular concerns, and are willing to help in making that happen, Im sure we can arrange that. :slightly_smiling_face: 

583 :  Largely a duplicate of #19826 from earlier this year.  The answer is still 'no'. 

584 :  If you don't have anything relevant to say, stay quiet 

585 :  Your heavy-handed and dismissive approach to moderation diminishes the project and the whole community. 

586 :  Just because you are afraid taking responsibility doesn't mean someone else won't step up to it. 

587 :  Just because you are afraid taking responsibility doesn't mean someone else won't step up to it. 

588 :  You suck at it. 

589 :  it's bullshit solution. 

590 :  It's hard to predict what you want, because it's not clear what you want. 

591 :  Jesus, I wish you guys STFU and get back to work instead. 

592 :  Too bad maintainers do not mute the thread. 

593 :  I'll have to unsubscribe from the ticket because it's unbearable to get emails with flame wars. 

594 :  I've been spending WAY too much time on adding bootstrap 4 with npm to a webpack project. 

595 :  I just installed, included, imported and my app just runs fine, no errors, but yet no col-md or container styling working.. meh, i'll just return to CDN's... 

596 :  But also, I don't want to be mean but I would prefer not to have this kind of discussions. 

597 :  This is once again NOT a bug and it is up to you to now change the way you deal with your animations. 

598 :  If you don't want to call it a bug, it's very bad design at the very least. 

599 :  I am **once again**, going to explain how the frame property works within the engine: you select a frame, which is numbered from left to right, then from top to bottom. 

600 :  And once again, there is nothing to fix here, unless you have a real solution" to the problem." 

601 :  we won't solve your problem by introducing workarounds in the code, sorry. 

602 :  What the hell? 

603 :  Your issue doesn't contain a single bit of useful information anybody could act on. 

604 :  At best the problem is that your expectations are wrong and you blame Angular instead of adjusting yourself, and the worse case is that you are just spreading spam. 

605 :  Angular works great for most. If it doesn't for you it's highly likely the problem is on your end. 

606 :  You need to stop acting like 3-year old. 

607 :  You need to stop acting like 3-year old. 

608 :  Grow up, get your sh*t together and stop spamming. 

609 :  don't cry, contributor, you are not blame that you are into that sh*t 

610 :  the reality is just opposite, it is the very suitable framework especially for real big projects. Just to guess, your problem is probably that you see it / try to use it by the same way as from jQuery point of view which is totally wrong way. 

611 :  whats the problem to answer this question? 

612 :  I don't even understand what the problem is and you don't seem to be interested to explain it. 

613 :  I don't even understand what the problem is and you don't seem to be interested to explain it. 

614 :  LOL - you simply closed my issue - where is your interest? 

615 :  LOL - you simply closed my issue - where is your interest? 

616 :  Because you do not know the answer about the raw response in gitter? 

617 :  I don't even care if that is directly in your code or was pulled in via a dependency bump. 

618 :  I'd say that's much worse than a temporarily broken build. 

619 :  I'm sorry my fuckups have caused you pain. 

620 :  And even if you do feel there is responsibility, you should not be so rude. 

621 :  Unintended breaking changes happen, but blaming it on the consumers is not an appropriate response. 

622 :  your reaction to the mistake being brought to your intention is somewhere between condescending and hostile. 

623 :  Instead you said that it's good that your mistake broke my build. 

624 :  You could have said sorry, this was not intended, let me roll back and re-release as 4.0.0" and it would be fine." 

625 :  You could have said sorry, I didn't consider that the yargs API practically becomes part of the lerna API, I will make sure that future SemVer major updates of yargs only happen in SemVer major updates of lerna"" 

626 :  However, I do see much evidence that you are trying to crash through head first through Angular and I see it as you feel it should just work the way you want it to... 

627 :  You either consume it all OR you will be wingin' it" and fighting the current of how things actually work versus how you want them to work." 

628 :  **angular team doesn't care about users feedback at all** 

629 :  Soooooooooooo youre setting Angular on fire and saying bold shit in bold like the Angular team dont care about you cause you found relative pathing has an issue is an odd area 

630 :  I felt Angular 2 to Angular 4 stuck it to me in the ace hole butttttttttttttt alas past my bitching, it all was for the better 

631 :  The topic here has just been a bunch of bitching where I have found success in the CLI and lazy loading. 

632 :  Im NOT going to create some plunked to split hairs with you 

633 :  Unprofessional for Flutter team to have this issue for more than 1 year. 

634 :  It is just shows up the whole Google company style - quantity over quality. 

635 :  may I remind you of the code of conduct of this repository which strongly encourages a kind behaviour? 

636 :  you are really think that is the Apple's problem? 

637 :  No one is even assigned to this issue yet? 

638 :  Guys from Flutter team, you spend tone of time to learn algorithms, data structure, low level programming for get work in Google and for now is it actually that type of solution you wanna provide being hired by the one of the best company in the world? Crutch? 

639 :  Guys from Flutter team, you spend tone of time to learn algorithms, data structure, low level programming for get work in Google and for now is it actually that type of solution you wanna provide being hired by the one of the best company in the world? Crutch? 

640 :  When you solve this issue(instead of provide workaround) Flutter will be best SaaS decision in the world, even for iOS users! 

641 :  I wonder why neither my proposal of shipping MSL nor the proposal of an optimisation run got a response from anyone from the team. 

642 :  Guys, I think we should start reaching out to the press about this issue. 

643 :  Ultimately the priorities of the flutter dev team are set by business stakeholders, I think. 

644 :  Show us ONE request from ANYONE who asked for their TABs to be changed to spaces within their code when using the option KEEP TABS. 

645 :  Come on people, this is not rocket science, it's a text editor for $(Deity)'s sake! 

646 :  Obviously it's more convient to blindly deny it here rather than simply fix it. 

647 :  How about not commenting before understanding what you read? 

648 :  You butted into the middle of a discussion by putting words in my mouth because you haven't bothered to understand what I wrote. 

649 :  So now you are implying that I don't even know what I want? 

650 :  What's next, telling me to get used to doing things your way because reasons? 

651 :  If this is a feature, and not a bug, then someone please explain why, when **Always keep TABs** is selected, these TABs are being replaced by Spaces? 

652 :  It's VERY unpredictable and frustrating. 

653 :  It may be worse for you, but better for others.  Hence the dilemma :) 

654 :  You'd see things very differently if on some lines of your code, your spaces were constantly being replaced by tabs. 

655 :  99% of what you wrote translates into excuses to not even attempt to change anything because something could break while at the same time you are totally disregarding that it has already been broken for us, hence the bug reports. 

656 :  99% of what you wrote translates into excuses to not even attempt to change anything because something could break while at the same time you are totally disregarding that it has already been broken for us, hence the bug reports. 

657 :  it is clear that you enjoy imposing your way on others given your ban on tabs" which you mentioned above." 

658 :  So far you have not addressed any of my points, instead you keep spouting some weird mix of anti-tab religious zealotry and corporate PR talk. 

659 :  At the risk of getting banned from commenting on this and every other Microsoft repo I am going to call you out on your bullshit -- you, Sir, are full of it and presenting rational arguments to you is a colossal waste of time. 

660 :  At the risk of getting banned from commenting on this and every other Microsoft repo I am going to call you out on your bullshit -- you, Sir, are full of it and presenting rational arguments to you is a colossal waste of time. 

661 :  i am out of here, and I will be advocating in my company to drop Visual Studio licensing. 

662 :  Maybe you will learn to honor user's preferences when they hit you in the wallet. 

663 :  It's open for God knows for how long just like this one. 

664 :  This misbehavior on tabs was reported shortly after the release of the VS2015 version, multiple times, by different people. 

665 :  You developed an new auto format engine and it fails to give the same good experience as the one that was used before and instead of fixing it, you prefer to spend hours of discussion with arguments that have nothing to do with the given issue. 

666 :  How much patience do you expect, by people that have to deal with this bug on every day? 

667 :  That is NOT expected behaviour. 

668 :  And today here we are approx. 6 years since the release of Visual Studio 2015 where the issue was introduced and you are telling me that you need more time to make sure someone is not negatively impacted while people using tabs are negatively impacted for 6 years and counting. 

669 :  I hope by now you are noticing a pattern, because the same kind of discussion is going on here as well. 

670 :  If you do bother to read those discussions as I asked you to, you will hopefully see how much of my personal time and effort I have spent on submitting the issue, and explaining things that Microsoft's own software engineers should have known better than me. 

671 :  In case what I am hinting at isn't clear, the difference is that I am a customer who is paying for the OS and dev tools licenses who is spending own free time to help improve things, and your colleagues are doing this on the salary and with this kind of response I am getting I have absolutely no incentive to contribute further. 

672 :  I have the urge to drop Microsoft products and suggest to the company I work for that we do the same wherever we can 

673 :  So no other editor exhibits this behaviour, no editor before 2015 exhibited this behaviour, people are here reporting it as a bug, but you're are suggesting that it fixed some problem endemic since the dawn of computing. 

674 :  That's bemusing to me, but if you're happy with it, then lucky you. 

675 :  Why It's not working? >:E There is no objective reasons for that. 

676 :  Do not distract me for this nonsense 

677 :  It would be much easier to understand if you simplified the example somewhat (remove the extra calls inside your auth service) and explained what you're actually looking for. 

678 :  This issue doesn't provide the steps to reproduce, or the exact expectation you're looking for with the example provided. 

679 :  i am from india my name is ramjeet widevin is shit .!! 

680 :  I'll be brief: It's because of guys like you that this device is being revoked. 

681 :  You - the person creating this issue is shit btw 

682 :  not widevine or the player, not even hiding the fact that you're using decryption keys illegally. 

683 :  It's because of people like you that real device owners and users can't use their devices as expected anymore. 

684 :  if you violate our code of conduct again, you will be permanently banned. 

685 :  Why is this issue still assigned to the `2.5 milestone` when `ansible 2.5` is already release a long time ago ? 

686 :  Running into this issue again and it sucks. 

687 :  Please guys, this issue has been open for almost 2 years now and for people who really use ansible-vault, this is a major pain the butt. 

688 :  We need a new free option, this is a core component and cannot be outsourced to 3rd party companies.  **THIS IS TOO CRITICAL** 

689 :  If you can't afford $1500 a year for IdentityServer4 to manage something as critical as identity for your business applications, drop them a line and let them know - pricing software products is a complicated business. 

690 :  OSS software isn't about other people doing things for you for free 

691 :  Funny how while it's been free, depending on 3rd parties has never been a problem... 

692 :  we'll make an announcement when ready"" 

693 :  Microsoft doesn't have to own everything dotnet. 

694 :  The sky isn't falling. 

695 :  If the answer is none" then _you're the problem_." 

696 :  I don't expect some - again VERY BASIC - functionality in my tech stack to change the licence 180°. 

697 :  It was their mistake to promote IS in the first place without making sure that it keeps the same license **forever** 

698 :  What an idi0t, not ok, just because he dont agree with someone else view. 

699 :   is out of line with personal comments like that. 

700 :  Clearly there's complexity in auth in general and within IS, and let's not pretend otherwise. 

701 :  Some of you were hopping over the line, some of you hopped over it, sprinted in the wrong direction and then threw things from 2.7 miles past the line. 

702 :  In any case, this is not the venue to discuss Duende's pricing, what open source means, and whether Microsoft should produce everything and kill off the .NET open source ecosystem in the process. 

703 :  We're done here and I'm locking the issue. 

704 :  Go linters complain when exported variables or constants are not documented (despite them being obvious in many cases), yet when core developers make major changes to go, they keep the old documentation, and don't even bother making it up-to-date. 

705 :  It was a neutral-tone, you might have never actually attached or imagined negative connotations to it if it weren't for me saying excuse me for my tone", which I have only said because I know how often people imagine hostility where there is none. :relaxed:" 

706 :  I cannot control how other people feel about me, and what emotions they attach to my statements. 

707 :  Despite what you say your words and actions do have a large impact on how people feel about what you write and how people interact with you. 

708 :  currently ` Dart` is more like: You want to do web? Sure, use AngularDart." (Hint: AngularDart != "the web")" 

709 :  LOL, no way. 

710 :  My commit is PUBLIC DOMAIN, do with it as you please. 

711 :  Perhaps also ask the lawyers what happens if someone later goes and fixes that typo. Thats basically stealing my public domain idea, regardless of your CLA, and then claiming it isnt because this wasnt known to you. 

712 :  Whacky position to be in :) 

713 :  Someone should start a GoFundMe campaign to pay for a lawyer who will challenge Google all the way to the Supreme Court, LOL 

714 :  I have OCD and I really want that typo fixed, now I know its there, it annoys me LOL. 

715 :  Can we please go back to focus on the issue at hand now, instead of having a meta discussion about how long people have had to test this. It is what it is right now, so let's look forward. 

716 :  I am amazed by how you, as the teacher, managed to avoiding pronouncing _any_ of the directives as en-gee" during the whole workshop." 

717 :  Did the girl really not notice the pattern of `ng-app`-`ng-init`-`ng-model`-`ng-if` leading to `ng-repeat`? 

718 :  Being curious about an official origin doesn't mean you're confused. 

719 :  a question on StackOverflow asking for the etymology of the `ng-` prefix is by no means evidence that it is a confusing name"." 

720 :  The project is already as inclusive as it gets: _everyone_ is welcome to use it and participate in its evolution by contributing, pointing out bugs, asking questions and helping others. Changing `ng-` to `ang-` would not affect this fact, positively or negatively. 

721 :  Furthermore, I am amazed by how you, as the teacher, managed to avoiding pronouncing _any_ of the directives as en-gee" during the whole workshop." 

722 :  I find it fascinating that someone at an Angular workshop was confused. 

723 :  Also, it would certainly not be easier to remember" because that would mean changing every existing material online." 

724 :  By this logic ang- is a terrible choice as it could stand for anything from negative words like ang-ry to religious words like ang-el. 

725 :  Trying to find two or three letters that are universally innocent in every language in a way that you cannot somehow turn them into something negative is probably an impossible task. 

726 :  Responding to that feeling by saying, basically, you are wrong" is practically providing proof that the angular community is not that welcoming." 

727 :  That sentence reads as a euphemism for that girl is stupid". Again: Not. Welcoming." 

728 :  Great, I'm glad you don't interpret `ng-repeat` negatively. 

729 :  It's so unbelievably annoying! 

730 :  This keeps coming up and it is SO ANNOYING. 

731 :  The people who's job it is to improve Visual Studio's user experience would be better equipped to fix this. 

732 :  Teams prioritizing things different from you is not negligence. 

733 :  The (ir)responsible team at Microsoft is neglecting a lot of users by not fixing this bug. 

734 :  It is a minor issue" in that it'd be easy for them to fix, although the choose not to.  It's not a "minor issue" in that it is indeed super annoying." 

735 :  And, as mentioned above, if that order doesn't fit your desires, you actually have something you can do about it. 

736 :  You seem to be seeking some sort of recognition and I must concede it to you. 

737 :  You have a knack for justifying inaction. 

738 :  I don't have time.  Nor really for this pointless discussion, although I hope you got something out of it at least. 

739 :  If you view my willingness to work with you to fix hte issues you care about as inaction" then that's on you." 

740 :  Thus it would be very unreasonable to expect app developers to do _even more_ work in the form of _unpaid_ casual side-jobs for various other projects such as Visual Studio etc, while simultaneously trying to perform their normal job 

741 :  It would be wildly unreasonable to expect app developers to sacrifice all of the following.  * Sacrifice mental health (re burn-out) as a consequence of excessive workload / unpaid side-jobs. * Sacrifice the proper raising of own children (applicable to everyone that has children), because of excessive time and energy spent doing unpaid side-jobs, resulting in insufficient time/energy remaining to properly raise and take care of children. * Sacrifice the relationship with partner/girlfriend/boyfriend/wife/husband. * Sacrifice a healthy amount of social life with friends and relatives (this loss can also lead to degradation of mental health). * Sacrifice relaxation/leisure time (insufficient leisure time also damages mental health). * Sacrifice fair working conditions and remuneration for staff members of businesses. * Sacrifice ethical behavior. 

742 :  However, it would be wildly unreasonable to expect to sacrifice himself like you do. 

743 :  My personal opinion is that your behavior appears to be unethical, inappropriate, and unprofessional, and it does not belong in any GitHub repository linked with Microsoft. 

744 :  Does that not strike you as ridiculous? 

745 :  You seem strangely passionate about defending their inaction. 

746 :  This is a delightful vignette about why we have rebindable key actions, and why we don't want to be prescriptive with user experience where terminal input" is concerned." 

747 :  your comment makes zero sense here. 

748 :  What C++ and/or Swift do isn't part of our decision making process for C#. 

749 :  'annoying' was not part of the decision making process. 

750 :  The language direction is not decided by polls. 

751 :  It should not be about believing or feeling ... It is not technical terms, there is should be Mind Map - what this feature will provide and allow to achieve ... 

752 :  It is entirely about that.  The language design group chooses which features are added to the language based on their personal beliefs and feelings. 

753 :  You underestimate our real usage 

754 :  Because he's continually said that this proposal had been rejected, he's said why it was rejected, and thus all this complaining on a rejected issue is just noise. 

755 :  If you want to talk about it further, do so where you have been asked to go. 

756 :  If you don't want to do that, you obviously don't care as much about your proposal as you seem to. 

757 :  This isn't your language. If it was, you'd be free to make all the changes you want, whatever the consequences, but it isn't. 

758 :  This isn't your language. 

759 :  Whether you did that or not is entirely up to you, but please stop moaning here, as you have been politely asked to do multiple times... 

760 :  I've seen you get upset and belligerent before when a proposal didn't go the way you wanted - it's getting old. 

761 :  But then the argument and debate must go into the gutter like chat channel to make it easier to forget, that's all reasoning I could understand about why we need to go there, the team just don't want to listen or even have clear evidence that people appeared to go against your decision (I might be overthinking things but this was one technique a dictator would used to suppress opinion of people) 

762 :  But for assumption that this feature will have `minimal usage` is very unlikely and very vague argument 

763 :  But not only there are no further explanation, you just demand people voice's to be drained into gitter and discord instead of the issue topic itself. 

764 :  This is what I really would called unreasonable 

765 :  But now you just don't want discussion to be under the issue and we don't have reason why it changed 

766 :  NOISE!! 

767 :  The difference is that those people gracefully did as was suggested as opposed to continually whine. 

768 :  You are acting like a petulant child, so I ask once again, if you're not willing to follow Cyrus' suggestion to move this discussion, PLEASE STOP! 

769 :  You seem to have some entitled opinion that just because you would find something useful, everybody else must, and thus it must be included in the language, and you're not willing to accept no" as an answer." 

770 :  END. FINIS. DONE. 

771 :  The decision making process is not done in a measured or mechanical fashion. 

772 :  This entire meta discussion on how people want the language designed is not useful here. 

773 :  (insert ominous music here) 

774 :  You guys aren't big fans of the KISS principle, I see. 

775 :  Microsoft once again doesn't fail to disappoint. 

776 :  my next action will be to get rid of this software immediately. 

777 :  I _dont_ appreciate you expressing it by heaping it on top of everybody I work with. 

778 :  Hi! Im a real person, happy to have a dialogue about that. 

779 :  This isn't the first time Microsoft is forcing good ideas" down my throat - if it was, I'd be happy to ask you about them directly, but this is just another data-point in a long history of similarly user-hostile actions." 

780 :  The irony of this statement is significant. You are literally clueing the user in to the opposite. I performed a customisation, and it is undone. This doesn't appear to be customisable"" 

781 :  You're right that our userbase is a technical audience, which is why we expected them to be able to <!--rub two brain cells together, and-->take the four seconds it takes to read the synthesized JSON, see the `hidden": false` that we stick in there, and think "hmm, maybe that hides the profile ”"." 

782 :  How about ASKING THE USER? Did that ever cross your mind? 

783 :  Hey, I've detected that you've made a change in the config. I'm about to undo all your work and confuse the hell out of you, Would you like me to continue?"" 

784 :  I even had people write to me to fix this today, that you guys are not seeing this is a huge issue like it is, shows where your priorities are. 

785 :  I know that also see people having this issues daily and even he has it, it's funny you guys dont think that is a huge problem.. 

786 :  As I stated, there is not enough time to duplicate all CI builds and to fix all the bugs that would get uncovered from there. 

787 :  The tool should serve the purpose, not the other way around! 

788 :  If you decide to solve it what's the point of saying in the middle okay now it's too difficult"." 

789 :  you should already know that things that *appear* trivial can, in fact, turn out to be intractable, and being combative about that helps no one. 

790 :  Did you a) (only) respond to the issue, or did you b) choose to unnecessarily attack my experience? 

791 :  So feels like it is the other way around to me. ‚ 

792 :  your attitude here makes my day measurably worse. 

793 :  I've asked you to do this once already and am not going to ask a third time - if you continue to be combative to people just trying to help, we'll be asking you to discontinue your engagement on the issue tracker. 

794 :  Your comment is insulting and more than useless 

795 :  bitch needs a slap 

796 :  Keep in mind that violations of the code of conduct can result in being banned. 

797 :  I always try to remind participants that we are *all* striving to make TypeScript better - but if you want to participate, the only way to do so is with respect. 

798 :  We can't tolerate abrasive language or tone on this issue tracker, and it has clearly become a problem here, so I'm closing the thread. 

799 :  If you cannot do that, we cannot allow you to engage on the issue tracker. 

800 :  I'm fed up the whole framework is filled with this crap. 

801 :  Why you even do double way binding if works half the needed cases? 

802 :  Don't even make a framework at this point 

803 :  It has no fucking sense. 

804 :  If the customer didn't specifically asked for angular I would have thrown this piece of trash in the toilet long time ago 

805 :  Thumbs down my ass, it's reality  that smacks your face 

806 :  Spoiler: no template i have no time to waste 

807 :  Instead of thumbing down like twitter and facebook kids, show me I'm wrong ¥‡ 

808 :  thumbs down don't bother me, take some relief on your real life frustration and let them rain down ’¯ 

809 :  Thats the damn problem 

810 :  Hundreds of issues at day you say. A stable and mature and professional product after all these years shouldnt. 

811 :  Instead it leaves you clueless with these kind of things and stupid documentation which is a copy paste from semi working code samples from tour of heroes which in some case alre also wrong and with errors in it. 

812 :  Yeah don't cry in silence and show us your strong arguments against my point 

813 :  This long reply is to show that I'm not just an angry fool, lot of people is fed up with it and it actually is an half baked crippled tool 

814 :  But there is an even more FUNNY thing. I AM ACTUALLY ALREADY USING setValue even before writing this post!!! 

815 :  At some point you have to trust engine contributors to know what bugs are. 

816 :  Here, renamed, be happy. 

817 :  This is getting silly already. No way it makes any sense. 

818 :  How is this offtopic? Please stop bringing politics into development world. That's just mindblowingly silly. 

819 :  That is hilarious. 

820 :  What is the next requirement OpenJS will ask for? To remove the **test** directory to avoid similarity with **test**icles? 

821 :  I'm not understanding why tasks could be included dynamically, but a playbook wouldn't be. 

822 :  I need to conditionally import a playbook, which isn't possible.  The keyword I'm missing is include_playbook" which would allow a "when" to apply to it." 

823 :  Of course we do. 

824 :  Oh, so you monitor them, but completely ignore them. Much better. 

825 :  You are making toxic and unhelpful statements. 

826 :  If you want to continue to make mean and unhelpful assumptions and remarks, go ahead, but then we can just close down this whole thread as well. 

827 :  Sarcasm and profanity will not help you get your issues resolved. 

828 :  I find it extremely frustrating using terminal as a REPL. 

829 :  I think it's quite stubborn to say you know what your users want. 

830 :  TBH, you really can't force down the throat of what tastes bland. 

831 :  If you don't like the new window, that's fine. 

832 :  If you don't want to give feedback on the new idea, because you just want us to fix the original REPL, that's fine too. 

833 :  Actually, please don't fix it. I am not paying you. And you believe you have the best idea, and that my request is too much. 

834 :  No, I don't think spending some personal time investigating a problem you have with a software you got from me for free is rude"." 

835 :  I've pointed out your mistake and you are perfectly capable of spotting the difference between the original configuration that was working and you've commented out and the one you've changed and that don't. 

836 :  Too bad that you do not consider this rude 

837 :  you do not care. 

838 :  it just not helpful to make false statements like: 'works for me' and 'you messed up writers' because you did not bother to run the repro-case following very simple instructions. 

839 :  If I state that your sample works for me", it of course means that I did bother running it on my side and didn't get to reproduce the issue you're mentioning." 

840 :  Perhaps the Linux project should change its name as they've conflicted with a city in Hawaii which existed long before. 

841 :  I feel like there's much less confusion between a city in Hawaii and a multi platform app framework both called Maui than a multi platform app framework and a multi platform app framework both called Maui. 

842 :  So you think of a Hawaian city when reading Maui", but not when reading "MAUI"? Really?" 

843 :  You find the comparison between a city in Hawaii and MauiKit ridiculous just like I find your comparison between an the Maui abbreviation and MauiKit ridiculous 

844 :  So yeah, there's an obvious naming clash here 

845 :  How is having two product with the same name and same basic scope (multi platform framework) a non issue? 

846 :  this project you're fighting for so passionately, doesn't have as many stars as I have thumbs down for telling you that you'e being ridiculous 

847 :  That's because GitHub stars are not a currency in which you measure a project that is not even developed on GitHub. 

848 :  I don't think they took into account either confusion with the Linux project" *nor with the Hawaiian island*." 

849 :  By the way, is it seriously necessary to mention that when there's an obvious name conflict with some other free software project in the exactly same domain (UI toolkit)? 

850 :  get over this Linux vs. Windows" mantra you still seem to follow." 

851 :  yes, this was half sarcasm, half serious comment. I think you can figure out which half's which. 

852 :  And this is not even a confusing _similarity_. We are talking about a multi platform framework called MAUI, and a multi platform framework called MAUI. 

853 :  You could've at least googled the name you were giving to your product before doing so, or choose one that's used from a product with a different scope. 

854 :  so you like this cute little side project... but let's be honest here when it comes to being a serious project it's not one. 

855 :  Your attitude is as if Microsoft is being some big evil corporation. 

856 :  Ok let's look at kde... there are 10 open issues... are you seriously going to tell me that a serious cross platform framework has 10 open issues... that's not realistic in any shape way or form. So again your complaints are just being ridiculous. 

857 :  The reality is I highly doubt anybody heard of MauiKit, and frankly nobody cares. 

858 :  Are you an _official_ Microsoft or Xamarin representative, and if so, is this the official position of your company?. 

859 :  What do you expect, providing some real arguments against nonsense or offending replies like you're all mad" or "it's the others' fault, they need to rename" (aka "we are Microsoft (related), we are bigger, you need to comply" or, my favorite, "same name is not a problem at all", pretending that confusion was not an issue..." 

860 :  great strategy, being offending once you run out of arguments! 

861 :  How can you seriously accuse others of like, thinking in this old it's a big evil company" way (which nobody really has), while yourself being extremely off-putting towards the open-source community? It makes no sense..." 

862 :  How can you seriously accuse others of like, thinking in this old it's a big evil company" way (which nobody really has), while yourself being extremely off-putting towards the open-source community? It makes no sense..." 

863 :  You have *zero* reason to belittle this or _any_ other open-source project. 

864 :  Imagine trying to put up a faÃ§ade with mslinux, then turning stuff into a dick size competition with repo stars and other stats because you know you messed up and don't want to admit it lmfao 

865 :  you want to see what a real Open Source application framework looks like I suggest you start taking notes. 

866 :  It is unethical, you are don't have any arguments? 

867 :  I don't know how you can question the seriousness of one of the biggest communities that drive open source principles many years before Microsoft fell in love with open source. 

868 :  So a project has value based on open issues? 

869 :  There appear to be more passive-aggressive comments towards another project in this thread from you alone than there are from all other people towards this .NET repository. 

870 :  Unless you _actually_ work for the companies involved, your opinion is probably negligible here. 

871 :  I'm surprised no one complained about Microsoft's use of the name `core` 

872 :  What I do see is a bunch of people who want to complain but probably never have used Xamarin and probably never will use Maui regardless of what it's called. 

873 :  Beautiful! You steal name and say that it's OK! Good position! 

874 :  ... not sure if you expect us all to email you now, but please be prepared... 

875 :  Isn't that the exact opposite thing that any sane person would do? 

876 :  Its OK to be passionate but attacking another open source project for any reason is not okay. 

877 :  This is not the kind of community we want to have and such behavior will not be tolerated. 

878 :  Using sexual abusive language is not the way to express your opinion. 

879 :  Your assumption about that it's self-descriptiveness is only _partially_ correct when you refer to several ppl you mentioned. 

880 :  I myself try avoiding to assume that other people see and understand things exactly the same way as me, because every individual has their own unique experience. That said I encourage you to not make such assumptions here. 

881 :  You give false impression to others. 

882 :  Brian should argue his case from a position of hands on, mature knowledge rather than having us collect that for him and demanding his proposal be accepted unmodified and that none of us is in a better position than to test and evaluate the suitability of including the proposal of porting `canonicalize` unmodified into the go standard library for Windows than he himself and the company he works for. 

883 :  It's fairly frustrating to see my words being repeatedly 

884 :  You're incorrect 

885 :  I don't appreciate trying to have the last word on this argument after I told you I don't wish to debate it. 

886 :  Not only is your comment extremely insulting to the work my team is doing, you keep going and rambling we caAaAn't truUust theEem theEey're the deviIil in disguiIise"." 

887 :  I find this behavior ridiculous, entitled, and generally not up to the standard our community should strive for. 

888 :  Everyone who disagrees with me doesn't know what they are talking about"" 

889 :  Nice, the only notable contribution you've ever made anywhere on Github is making sure everyone at Google knows you're a racist. 

890 :  BlackLivesMatter is not meant to be a racist statement, except you see it like this. 

891 :  So you need fix it in you county, and do not force your problems to all world! 

892 :  Anyway this issue will be closed without an answer since Google doesn't care about people but sticking to their narrative. 

893 :  Everyone here will be called a white supremacist antiblack antiasian antilgtbteq1324 and risking to be banned from the repo. 

894 :  Welcome to 1984. 

895 :  Nothing more cringey than tech framework sites posting about politics, even if you agree with the sentiment. 

896 :  You know what, the white A" in the Angular logo is all of a sudden making me feel uncomfortable...maybe even a little oppressed. Hmm, could the Angular team be racists??? Maybe we should make a separate issue to change the color to black." 

897 :  Just noticed the #BlackLivesMatter banner on the home page for the first time...what a joke. 

898 :  Anyone have a list of other political movements endorsed by the Angular site? 

899 :  What's racist about it? Also don't shame others based on their skills and development experience. That's against the code of conduct. 

900 :  All lives matter" isn't racist either, yet apparently saying that makes you a white supremacist or something." 

901 :  People can express their opinions but the mods are just gonna lock it away cause y'all can't behave" and "the discussion is getting out of hand and is not productive anymore"" 

902 :  Funny how the first comment is being sarcastic about [the master branch] 

903 :  I guess I'll give up my Master's degree to show solidarity. 

904 :  why is it on the front-page of Angular and **what is the criteria** which determines what gets on the front page. **Who decides what's important enough?** 

905 :  If you're so sure that it's such a good idea, why do you have to act so quick about locking it so as not to give people a chance to give their opinion on the matter? 

906 :  But it just feels less and less a framework and more and more a political board. 

907 :  Why are you using this platform for displaying your political agenda. You have other platforms to do that. No one wants this here. 

908 :  This crap has gotten way out of control, give em an inch and they'll try to take a mile. 

909 :  Enough is enough already, rather than people getting offended by a word that is not offensive in this context, 

910 :  I can't believe the insanity that's going on. 

911 :  That's the context and the only context. 

912 :  I guess my `Masters Degree` now has to renamed to `Main Degree` as well.. 

913 :  Simply stupid. 

914 :  Stupid, like all this progressive shit destroying everything it touches. 

915 :  Simply stupid. There's no other way to put it. Stupid, like all this progressive shit destroying everything it touches. 

916 :  I recommend you finding another tool where you can work with easily without headache yourself with this particular one. This is what I did myself. 

917 :  You have missed some quotes around a string. 

918 :  I am a scikit-learn newbie and have just have spent a frustrating time going thought the docs, and I can't find anywhere how to read my own data (and not a prepared toy dataset), and what the python format of data is. 

919 :  I don't know whether you are one of scikit-learn staff or not, but I need to say that your way of talking is harming both scikit-learn staff and users (us) 

920 :  you seem quite misinformed about what is scikit-learn, how it works, and how the project is developed. 

921 :  it's literally your job. or you are here just to spam random stuff till people get pissed off and leave? 

922 :  your comments look absolutely random with quite zero connection to the reality. either a bot or ... very unintelligent person. which is fine by me as long as you keep a distance from me. 

923 :  so, if you don't know a solution, DO NOT POST ANY COMMENTS. 

924 :  and again  if you don't know a solution, DO NOT POST ANY COMMENTS. 

925 :  bot or something? your comments look absolutely random with quite zero connection to the reality. either a bot or ... very unintelligent person. which is fine by me as long as you keep a distance from me. 

926 :  There is no need for personal insults or caps. 

927 :  i dint yet started the insults. its called personal observation. look it up. 

928 :  what consoles and what modes? (did you actually read the ''To Reproduce'' ????? i have the feeling you didnt) 

929 :  now i have the feeling you didn't read anything at all. 

930 :  or you just assume that if it works for you work for absolutely everyone? 

931 :  you have not actually commented here regarding the problem or the intention to fix it. 

932 :  A bit of research can help you get the info you need in order to be able to perform the necessary tests to confirm/deny your theory so you can start acting on knowledge. 

933 :  Seeing this issue as well, its very annoying. 

934 :  Now: it seems like the discussion here _has_ reached its terminus, so there isnt value in leaving it unlocked for angry people to get their digs in. 

935 :  while I fully understand your reasoning, this is detrimental to people learning how to use Ansible. 

936 :  AT LEAST remove the banner for people that are not in the US. 

937 :  No, it got locked because people disagree with your ignorant stance. 

938 :  I will not participate in a dictatorship as you're too dumb on the matter to be my leader. 

939 :  You guys suck at everything! 

940 :  WTF Microsoft! 

941 :  Microsoft should grow turnips instead of writing software! 

942 :  I would be tempted to blame legalization for this kind of mishap, but you guys have always sucked at software! 

943 :  Windows sucks and now you even made .NET, your crown jewels, suck! 

944 :  This wasted several hours of my time trying to work through the suggested troubleshooting tips 

945 :  Can't you guys get anything done without turning it into a nightmare? 

946 :  Everything you guys put your hands on sucks! 

947 :  Relax and take your medication. 

948 :  So I guess I need to be smoking the same grass you're smoking in order to medicate my way out of seeing Microsoft's mediocrity?  No thanks! 

949 :  Because we can undo it" is not a good reason to present bad statistics." 

950 :  So as long as everyone reads through at least the first 39 pages of the Unicode standard then there shouldn't be any problem. 

951 :  Meanwhile, you've provided zero evidence to support your claim, which is based solely on your personal experience. 

952 :  It's no wonder that even Google's own engineers could care less about the company's style guides. 

953 :  And here I'd thought that Google workers were above mansplaining.  Stupid me 

954 :  It's a very convenient way of saying that the bug I had in my code was a bug with my design rather than the .Net Native compiler even though my code did/should work in any given .Net runtime context, but .Net Native is special, thus requiring special design considerations. 

955 :  before you close this issue you will have to adjust where you point the finger. 

956 :  The problem isn't with MessagePack, according to @MichalStrehovsky the problem is your design choice since you, being on the inside of Microsoft, have an even better understanding of the way the .Net Native compiler works. 

957 :  It may be a PITA to have .Net Native issues surfaced this way. 

958 :  Both the comment you make and the way initiated the closure of this issue was disingenuous. 

959 :  Just say so and stop pretending that any of the .Net Native compiler problems will actually be addressed. 

960 :  A year went by on the gRPC issue.  A year with no resolution!  I'd even be ok with a form of admission and a statement along the lines that we need to resolve these issues ourselves.   At least that way, time wouldn't be wasted on false expectations. 

961 :  ou're wasting a lot of our time slandering our competence 

962 :  You can censor me if you like. 

963 :  you keep bringing it back to advocating for breaking compatibility in the language design as if this was the same level of implication. 

964 :  I'm tired of this bikeshedding. I tried to advocate for keeping this issue focused on the actual bug that can be fixed (syntax highlighting) 

965 :  Seems more like Bram enjoys taking all the credit. 

966 :  It literally takes less than 30 minutes to learn git. That's no excuse. 

967 :  No, I don't understand.  Any software developer doing things exactly the same as 10 years ago is a **bad** software developer, let alone 30 years ago. 

968 :  To think that a new idea is better than an old one simply because it is new is foolish. 

969 :  When looking for information about Vim, the place to look is always the built-in help. Not Google, not the manpages, not the github metadata, just the help. In this case: :help credits 

970 :  So, instead of ranting here, maybe you should try to find the cause of the problem and/or open a PR that fixes this kind of issue, if necessary. 

971 :  This seems unnecessarily hostile, especially given that, in your own words, - I shouldn't complain about software I had nothing to pay for"" 

972 :  Have you considered simply reporting the issue, without any of the assholery? 

973 :  If you would like to re-open another GitHub issue calmly describing your problem with less vitriol and toxicity, I will gladly add it to my next release milestone, I'll add a test case for the situation, and I'll forget that this exchange happened. 

974 :  Sorry to say, that I am totally pissed off from this worst programmed piece of software/plugin I have ever seen. 

975 :  You actually need to keep hearing our feedback, every one of us. 

976 :  you should be working to find the screams because it takes tons of effort for us to get the screams close to you. 

977 :  you should want to know about all of these peoples feedback, especially when its them screaming in paper cut agony. 

978 :  So, let's put it straight, with the largest, boldest letters: **THIS IS NOT A FLUTTER ISSUE, There is no Flutter solution or workaround and never will be.** 

979 :  don't be stupid, it's a bug 

980 :  Your belief that you're doing anyone a favor by varying from the expected command line tool behavior, you should turn in your commit per.issions and get a job in management where you don't have access to break things AGAIN. 

981 :  By not doing what the command line tools do, you are varying from the expected behavior and breaking convention. THIS IS WRONG. 

982 :  Save your energy. Lex has rejected this again and again. 

983 :  Put your overlays as extra quads into your item model, he says. 

984 :  Threatening to coremods shit because you haven't spent 10 mins looking into other solutions is not the way to get things added to forge. 

985 :  It's pretty useless to complain about someone not looking without pointing them in the right direction. 

986 :  It's excruciatingly abrasive and dickish and impedes fostering a community that actually wants to contribute to a project. 

987 :  Going off on someone because you assume they haven't searched for other solutions makes you look like a dick. 

988 :  I don't care if you consider my response dickish, your initial post was. 

989 :  i'm sick of being threatened by people and coremods. 

990 :  I would have loved to work with you, but since you were not willing to accept any recommendations, I am closing this and we will do any remaining work in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/48058. 

991 :  WTF guys, you can't make built version of app? 

992 :  so to use it i need to download huge amounts of not needed data and applications? That not how the Linux works. 

993 :  And also polite mean to make installation for users, and not throwing in their faces some code and say do whatever you want with it"." 

994 :  t's really not that hard to understand... 

995 :  Why don't you develop your own terminal instead of asking like you are the CEO of Microsoft? 

996 :  Some people shouldn't act like a ass just because they think different. 

997 :  I agree that @creotiv should not act like an ass 

998 :  I didn't mean that but whatever floats your boat man. ƒ 

999 :  Where's your binaries?  Just because it's early and incomplete" (just like this code on this repo is) shouldn't be an excuse." 

1000 :  3 month to make an installer for an app)) that's nice) 

1001 :  Look, 24h later, a valid tiny patch is still not merged and we'd need to discuss" why shippable failed on its improvement, not even on the patch itself." 

1002 :  I can submit the bug elsewhere but do you really mean to suggest that I need to know about HPLIP and cups-filters to understand why three different tools process the options I've set (using your software) in three different ways? 

1003 :  Who takes responsibility when other projects don't know how to interface correctly with your software? 

1004 :  Are you ever grateful to receive bug reports about your project? 

1005 :  You don't think any of your documentation needs to be fixed? 

1006 :  So cups-pdf is HP's problem too? Is there any Linux software you can name that interfaces with CUPS correctly? 

1007 :  Is there any Linux software you can name that interfaces with CUPS correctly? 

1008 :  It would help to have an answer to this question, relating to the configuration of face-up printers 

1009 :  Please look at this, because @raver119 is still angry I said C wasn't a good language. 

1010 :  I don't even remember who you are. 

1011 :  That's a bit of surprising statement. 

1012 :  P.s. sorry. Just too many people around. 

1013 :  Keep it professional or I won't hesitate to ban you from interacting with this repository. 

1014 :  Just seems pointless to continue supporting something that uses so much developer time. 

1015 :  You can do that, but don't blame the software then. 

1016 :  You still try to push Salt to adhere to OMV data format, while common sense says it should be otherwise. 

1017 :  i alreeady said it was kneejerk impulse, so you eems to be crashing through door wide open. 

1018 :  You blaze of ego is called for. 

1019 :  Yesterday i spent hours looking into Salt code and patching it along your suggestions. 

1020 :  First i took your suggestions as correct and thought through. And just followed them. An then had to undo it all. 

1021 :  Now you imply it was your time wasted not mine. 

1022 :  you refused to help me doing it. 

1023 :  You made me look into Linux kernel i am not familiar with, at the same time you are not very willing to point me to specific OMV code and Salt commands you are familiar with. 

1024 :  you are funny :) 

1025 :  you can learn a bit about semantics, grammar and the meanings of words - essentialy about language and usage :)  can you tell me who was here offended ? 

1026 :  when we have storage OOM gradle doesn't sygnalize that, instead proper info we have a bullshit :) 

1027 :  still some daemon shit WTF ??? 

1028 :  Flutter team, PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE PROPERLY! 

1029 :  It looks like no one from Flutter team cares about the issue. 

1030 :  I'm sorry but I have to be this guy... The fact is that you left this repository unanswered for two plain month. 

1031 :  you MUST understant that without repo's activity people will not be interested in SUI anymore, and you'll try to find funds for a dead project... 

1032 :  I am BEGGING @levithomason, @jlukic, or any other project owner to PLEASE add at least two more trusted owners or managers with the power to add more committers and maintainers so badly needed. 

1033 :  A 10 second look would of shown you that. 

1034 :  do not readd links in which I have removed, do it again and you'll be blocked. 

1035 :  I have instructed you on two paths on how to achieve your goal now. 

1036 :  I don't appreciate you basically calling me an idiot in all caps when you didn't bother to even consider that maybe I had a good reason for doing it the way I did. 

1037 :  Except, you don't have a good reason, if you would of worked with anyone in the community to figure things out before resorting to hacking things with a coremod then we would be having a different conversation. 

1038 :  Fuck you flutter, if macos adds PATH, it just wont join, go to hell, youre so ugly, Google is so big, will the script be configured to die? 

1039 :  This is why Linux products are the way they are, and why no one had ever heard of KDE MAUI until now -- you lot just argue about inane stuff instead of getting work done. 

1040 :  Are you a lawyer? Maybe you should check with one before you potentially commit business libel. 

1041 :  Yes, I am opening a new one because fuck you Microsoft. 

1042 :  You are merely trying to cast a shadow on other, truly open source projects. 

1043 :  why did you close this? 

1044 :  The maintainers of the project are using a dependency that is buggy, they should take care of this 

1045 :  That's your responsibility to take care of things that don't work as expected in the dependencies of your project. 

1046 :  You are advertising syntax highlighting, you are supposed to deliver! 

1047 :  And if you don't, you are supposed to take care of whatever is needed to have your product work as expected 

1048 :  We're not contractually obligated to work on every bug and answer every question, seeing as we simply don't have enough resources. 

1049 :  (I) really love this ability to minimize comments on GitHub.. :sparkles: 

1050 :  You got us. It's a joke. 

1051 :  I mean cmon guys, is this a joke? 

1052 :  It is ridiculously funny not having a password lock for the most sensible information inside the phone that leads to basically unlocking all of your secure accounts. 

1053 :  I mean cmon guys, is this a joke? 2FA without a feature to lock the screen from people? 

1054 :  Your tone is derogatory. 

1055 :  This is the incorrect approach based upon your issue. 

1056 :  You got my support on this @filmgirl. 

1057 :  rooting for you @filmgirl ‰ 

1058 :  11/10, want to see this happen! ’œ 

1059 :  Knowing that this is possible my life will not be the same without it 

1060 :  I can't believe it hasn't already been implemented, this is a must have feature. 

1061 :  This needs a kickstarter campaign 

1062 :  How have I been using Terminal without this feature for so long? I'm using plain old terminal until we have it! 

1063 :  This explains a lot and why microsoft made ton of bad decisions recently, maybe the people at the top are delusional? 

1064 :  This is really offending for people that are suffering for global warming and desertfication areas. 

1065 :  Also is that a natural snow icon or a fake snow icon? 

1066 :  Please think about how much water Is wasted to create artificial snow just for games 

1067 :  It is really offending me because I am very snow sensitive and get hurt by snowflakes when it is snowing. 

1068 :  If I see that on the VS code I feel physically hurt. 

1069 :  On the other hand snowflake is the best symbol for spineless corporations bowing down to any random activist complain. 

1070 :  Also there was some recent effort to associate snowflake and Santa with its red hat to drug consumption so please don't talk about Its red hat and snow symbol in the same thread. :smile_cat: 

1071 :  I am with you guys- the one **TROLL** that offended many, many people got his wish fulfilled. Only ONE person wanted this ridiculous change and you are just ignoring so many requests to bring back what was deleted. Shame on you, shame. 

1072 :  You're not my dad, I can use everything I like / dislike! 

1073 :  Please stop offended me! You're not my dad, I can use everything I like / dislike! 

1074 :  I'd be really  grateful if that the correct reaction will be delivered like the other one, snowflakes do hurt and sting in the eyes, I won't be able to sleep if I see all day this hurtful symbol of pain and climate oppression in my IDE. 

1075 :  Some guy in Microsoft HQ is sweating right now.  Although this is 100% deserved. 

1076 :  His name is **Christian**, that must be a troll account, too good to be true :D 

1077 :  I'm from New Zealand, and in the Southern Hemisphere, it's not cold, but hot during the holiday season. I suggest you geo-locate the user's position and prompt them for the icon of their choice, e.g. snow, ice, fire, sun shine. 

1078 :  Every Christian should be renamed immediately to eliminate possible offence. 

1079 :  This is a serious discussion about the terror that is snow flakes and how it terrorises a lot of people everyday, even more now with the new VS Code update. 

1080 :  I would also like to point out that snow(flake) is _white_ and is commonly used as a white supremacy symbol to oppress and marginalize whole ethnicities, which due to systemic geographic discrimination couldn't historically experience, first-hand, full range of weather phenomena. 

1081 :  Winter is one good buff against invaders in Russia. Praise the winter! Let it snow! 

1082 :  The Snow Flake on vscode insiders and pushing it as a cozy"/"wintery" thing is very offensive to me." 

1083 :  This isn't just me either, think about the people who cannot even get snow, think about how you're making them feel, making them see what they cannot get, although personally I don't understand that. Snow is terrifying. 

1084 :  Oh no, I just mentioned way too many forbidden things, so this is getting removed too. Along with this thread. And me. And you. 

1085 :  We must remove the hat, all mentions of the hat, all mentions of removing the mentions of the hat and so on, just to be sure. 

1086 :  That's way too rational, a guy was extremely offended, please have some consideration! 

1087 :  The removing of the Santa hat and catering to vocal minority of sjw idiots is very offensive to me. 

1088 :  If Santa is a religious figure, then so is the Grinch, 

1089 :  It's so sad that people are so sensitive in the world we live in today that this sort of thing is even worth discussion.. 

1090 :  My understanding is that he was actually upset of the pagan origins :man_shrugging: 

1091 :  It was removed all because of this one guy: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/87268 and he prob think that what he did is funny. 

1092 :  Got as far as to feel the joy of my parents being alive, but then a snowflake got in the way and I got offended. 

1093 :  In addition, it reminds me of black people lurking around. 

1094 :  Microsoft scares me by forcing people to use this theme. 

1095 :  Please don't laugh. This is a serious issue for me. I want to force removal of the feature for everyone, because it hurts my feelings. And no, don't make a toggle for it. It would remind me that a death is still there, but not visible. 

1096 :  I don't know if it makes any difference, but I'm a black Jew living in Uganda. 

1097 :  To avoid being offended, please use the transparent perspicuous pellucid theme. 

1098 :  Did you just say trans-parent? But it's ok, my conservative belifs can and even should be offended. 

1099 :  PC?! What if I'm a mac-user?! 

1100 :  Dark theme is basically a blackface of white editors. 

1101 :  VS Code dark theme reminds me of this situation, so please remove it immediately, because for me dark theme = death. 

1102 :  User Christian-Schiffer that created such awful request offended many users and Microsoft just standing there like nothing happened. 

1103 :  I demand syntax highlighting be removed, as it reminds me of the other night when I puked out the three plates of ravioli I'd eaten. It is very offensive to me and instantly brings back memories of a very bad stomachache. 

1104 :  I find the V" in "VS Code" offensive. It represents two fingers being held up in an obscene gesture and could be read as "F*ck You"." 

1105 :  This censorship is literally a new holocaust! 

1106 :  I'm extremely offended by the fact that because of religious beliefs @Mikotochan 's only life pleasure has been taken away. 

1107 :  You deserve an award for skyrocketting the level of drama of this topic  – ! 

1108 :  One time a random person told me to œgit good and since then, œgit is extremely offensive to me. 

1109 :  Please remove Python compatibility I'm scared of snakes. 

1110 :  It's funny and sad at the same time that one selfish issue can cause loss of hundrets of man-days (people-days?) across globe. 

1111 :  I enjoy reading drama, please don't take my only pleasure in life away. 

1112 :  I think it is necessary to **remove** this Terminal" word, as it can really offend someone's feelings in some country at some time." 

1113 :  Additionally Terminal" has cost millions of Jews their lives over the centuries because the word "terminal" could also mean ["Extermination Camp"]" 

1114 :  Terminal" might also remind someone about a terminal illness they are facing" 

1115 :  Oh my god! Man! It's something that I wish for the years! Christmas miracle literally exists! 

1116 :  people who thumb down the santa have never received a present from him, naughty boys 

1117 :  it seems like kernel trauma, it has befriended santa and now microsoft crushed its dreams 

1118 :  Please add also an ultra-offensive debugger that shitstorms you on every error 

1119 :  I also can't focus on my work since then, please let me be productive again 

1120 :  Please make it your top priority to bring Santa hat back. 

1121 :  Coding productivity has decreased enormously since the removal of the Santa hat. 

1122 :  Assuming he wasn't just trolling: if one gets butthurt and triggered over an emoji or icon, then the internet is not really the place where one should hang around. 

1123 :  Pandering to icon haters seems to be high on Microsoft's list instead of handling actual bug fixes or feature requests. 

1124 :  Are you happy @Christian-Schiffer? Your behaviour offence a lot of people around the world. 

1125 :  I think you must apologize to these people and @egamma must do it too. 

1126 :  Get back the Santa icon you morons 

1127 :  How much of a brain do you have to delete that icon as a result of hate speech of a single idiot? 

1128 :  XDDDDD careful. microsoft now owns github too and they also take direct orders from jerusalem. your account will be vanished in no time. their petty feelings are way above yours so hush now 

1129 :  This Santa Hat situation is unacceptable. This is outrageous and humiliating. 

1130 :  We demand apologies from @microsoft and that the Hat be back! 

1131 :  Im just sickk of having to go through thousnads of tutorials, forums, chats, emails and so on every time Unity updates, or the HoloToolkit or the MRDL or visual studio... It is just SUPER UNSTABLE and a serious pain in the *** to do anything. 

1132 :  This is the first time I've heard from you, so **let's open a new issue and try to figure out what's going on**. 

1133 :  I am dead serious, WHEN??? You are not adding/doing anything useful to it, nothing beneficial for the end user. 

1134 :  This conversation is over. 

1135 :  why the hell did you haphazardly change the initial value of properties in this commit??? 

1136 :  why the hell you break my code programmed against gradle 4.10 in the **very first** release after that??? 

1137 :  i can't believe you guys, this is completely irresponsible. and don't tell me you needed to do this to support property conventions, you didn't. 

1138 :  again, I insist my way to fix this problem, which is no doubt the most simple and efficient approach to this problem. 

1139 :  I don't care about which PR will be merged finally, but I do care about the most reasonable solution for this problem. 

1140 :  This isn't how we have technical disagreements. No amount of technical correctness can make up for treating other people poorly, please don't repeat that behavior. 

1141 :  I don't know why you're so hysterical about which PR should be merged, and what I want to clarify here is that obviously I found this problem before you, and I have not even found the existence of golang/net@08b3837 until @fisherxu mentioned it in my PR, that why I push a new commit using http2.ConfigureTransports today and open this [PR](https://github.com/golang/net/pull/84) trying to fix the problem before. 

1142 :  And besides I didn't have any reference on your PR as I have not even noticed you before. 

1143 :  you should learn how to use Git with clear&clean commit history. 

1144 :  You have disagreement but no reason. That's personal. 

1145 :  You are so unbelievably arrogant that I don't want to waste my time arguing with you. 

1146 :  No amount of technical correctness can make up for treating other people poorly 

1147 :  that's not a good excuse for doing nothing, not everybody like you github employees (I heard most atom developers are ?) has a macbook for each, and there are many ones still using old computers, ... 

1148 :  You still haven't addressed my concern with this Issue, @crquan, namely that there isn't a method of determining if Atom is beyond the size of an editor should be"." 

1149 :  Is 207MB too big? Is 200MB? Is 10MB? Please give an example of what size is small enough" and what size "too big" and, most importantly, why." 

1150 :  A bug is nearly worthless if it cannot ever be fixed. And without a clearly defined goal, this bug cannot be fixed. 

1151 :  want to speak directly, the words very cheap to buy a USB" seems really ridiculous." 

1152 :  That make no sense, why you make efforts to a open source, because you love it. when you love it, why not keep it the best. 

1153 :  your words looks so ridiculous too, I have to say. no offence.

-----
Original test dataset:

TEXT
1 :  Can you give indications on where the changes should happen and other indications? 

2 :  I am a bit lost in the source code 

3 :  My sincere apologies if I missed something. 

4 :  If I sound hostile, it because I am kindly sharing the user hostility you're unleashing on developers trying to get work done. 

5 :  I don't know anything about gclient or gyp, and I didn't see any documentation in the repo to lead me in the right direction (except the README, which tells me I should be looking in tools/). 

6 :  I'm afraid that without guidance/help I won't be able to move far with the port. 

7 :  I'm also having huge issues with building NSPR similarly to what was reported in comment #&#173,7 over an year ago. 

8 :  I would like to help .. just don't think I have the needed skills. 

9 :  Unfortunately since then work has been busy which left no time for further dart work. 

10 :  It's quite sad that not all of the interested parties were invited to the table. 

11 :  I understand your frustration at the delay in getting this in. 

12 :  It is possible that moving the files to third_party is not ideal but it does provide us a clean separation of the hosts that the Dart team ships periodically as install ready binaries in a SDK vs other hosts. 

13 :  If you have other ideas on how we can maintain this separation I am willing to listen. 

14 :  I had plans to make a proper port (with separate files and not patches on the linux ones) but after seeing how the Dart team treated the BSD ports efforts and specially Mulander's work ... I really got disappointed and lost all interest in Dart! 

15 :  I've likewise abandoned Dart because I see nothing in the Dart project to give me confidence that it will be ported. 

16 :  I'm willing to give it another look if things change, but I can't use something if it doesn't support the systems I deploy on. 

17 :  This would really help modularizing our code 

18 :  The lack of communication on one of, if not the most requested feature of the last 3-4 years is not something to appreciate. 

19 :  They decided to implement it which is great news, crass comments like these do not help anyone. 

20 :  apologise if you felt somehow attacked by my comment. 

21 :  Lose more games than the Jets and act like you are a team full of Tom Bradys. 

22 :  It would be great if aside from the current way of building widgets you could add JSX like capabilities. 

23 :  Sorry if I sound defensive or aggressive. :-) 

24 :  don't take my argumentative tone as dismissive, I'm very interested in your input here. 

25 :  Stop nit-picking things that are not fully specified. 

26 :  Make Flutter look familiar to React developers and you have a chance of attracting a bunch of new users to Flutter. 

27 :  Wow, could have written a blog post xD 

28 :  The point being, we haven't made any decisions yet, and are very open to learning what needs to be done based on all these discussions and experiments. 

29 :  That I appreciate and I read all your 'long writings', answering everything: no way, but when I answer properly you don't understand my answer and concludes that I am being dismissive. 

30 :  And if, by chance, he was being sincere, then I apologize for my snideness 

31 :  We are very interested to better understand your scenarios where WCF server side functionality is required. 

32 :  I have dreamed for years of having WCF across their entire network so that I can finally (!) have reliable transactions and durable services spanning their various generations of Linux and Windows. 

33 :  Having WCF on .Net core is not only desirable, it is essential. 

34 :  We have a strong need to run .NET/WCF on Linux, so please add this to the road map! 

35 :  Stop invest in dead technologies such as WCF and VB.NET, spending tremendous amounts of resources to nowhere, instead of spending for something good. 

36 :  Without WCF we will either have to abandon a lot of the plans or suffer a decrease in productivity.  :-( 

37 :  It's possible you misunderstood the comment. 

38 :  Do I like being productive, absolutely. That means, never using WCF. 

39 :  The code has been already updated, but `7.19.0` did not include this. :( 

40 :  it seems you're a little too caffeinated here : 

41 :  Mike you are a valued JIT contributor 

42 :  I didn't really think about it too much. 

43 :  I didn't really think about it too much.  I was just trying to keep things peaceful here. 

44 :  I honestly believe that his harsh remarks were not intentional. 

45 :  It would be a great loss for the .NET community if you'd stop contributing. 

46 :  If you consider my comment to be negative, just tell me and I'll happily remove it. 

47 :  I did not contribute to get praise, I only contributed for the fun of it. And it stops being fun if I have to deal with nonsense. 

48 :  I can very much relate to that. 

49 :  But we need to be careful that we don't use valuable contributions as a currency to offset disrespectful behavior. 

50 :  Let's just say that it is distasteful. 

51 :  I honestly don't follow any more 

52 :  Sorry to hear that, but what is causing here an issue for you? 

53 :  It supposed to be a discussion so you can ask questions too. 

54 :  Then I quickly deleted it, as I recognized that it was not a helpful reaction and wouldn't help advance the conversation. 

55 :  So excuse me if this is how you felt. 

56 :  Seriously, have I done something to you? 

57 :  I encourage everyone to report this package to npm as its breaking their rules and harmful for npm ecosystem and its attacking users computer. 

58 :  Report it to npm 

59 :  Stop taking money for something that should be free and open. 

60 :  I hope that there is a more reasonable way of asking for funding since this practice will encourage many other projects to do the same and it would be unfortunate for our terminal output logs to look like nascar advertisements after everyone starts doing the same thing, which starts looking like the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). 

61 :  It is sad that so many with such strong opinions have no contributions in the last year outside of this issue. 

62 :  I don't want to have to view advertisements in my CI logs, and I hate what this would mean if other packages started doing this. 

63 :  I didn't mean to suggest that anyone disagreeing was acting as part of a mob. It was meant to apply specifically to those people treating a github issue like it's a place for trolling, nasty comments, etc. My apologies if it came off that way. 

64 :  Just be decent and follow the community's rules. 

65 :  If you are going to rant, go to twitter. 

66 :  Hopefully someone more well versed in this domain can help figure out what is going on. 

67 :  In the end, would be nice if these errors were caught and the users were notified of the GUI of what actions might be needed. 

68 :  Let's all be respectful. 

69 :  Take your foul mouthed trolling to Twitter. 

70 :  Find one that you are satisfied with and use it. 

71 :  Grow up and move along. 

72 :  I hate that these things never actually get fixed or resolved 

73 :  We're having a real problem with this because ESLint ignores the .eslintrc.json file (due to some other bug in ESLint), and it breaks the build. 

74 :  I understand you're upset and this rule is causing problems for you. 

75 :  I've found that it helps to clearly describe the problem I'm encountering and propose some solutions or ask questions to understand the problem space better. 

76 :  I empathize with your frustration 

77 :  Life is too short 

78 :  And the worst part is that I feel helpless to improve the situation. I vote, I campaign, I phone bank, I donate, I protest, I write to officials, I try to inform others... and yet things just keep getting worse and worse. 

79 :  Adding your political beliefs to your licensing is petty. The irony is that this very project is hosted on a resource owned by Microsoft... 

80 :  I'm not as familiar with the react code base (clearly from my comments) but if there's anything you need help on to get this going let me know 

81 :  They haven't commented on any of the related issues and they've been open for months. 

82 :   @_ing from the react team to get some on this? Seems to be quite a lot of interest, but not a single issue on this topic has received a comment from a maintainer in 5 months. 

83 :  Just wanted to chime in and say I strongly feel the same way - it would be at least good to get a hey we won't be considering this"." 

84 :  I know this wasn't your intention 

85 :  I'm really feeling stupid for not being able to figure this one out :( 

86 :  Though I am confident that my analysis is decent enough, much of the code I was referencing was unfamiliar/new to me. 

87 :  I'm not experienced that, but I'll use it for a while to see what happens. 

88 :  If I'm misunderstanding what is being requested here, please let me know. 

89 :  And this whole text could be avoided if you guys simple had said:  yeah that was a bad idea, i will try to put your suggestion in a next changelog or add some tool to convert json/xml then json/plist and any other technology RC lays on"" 

90 :  It would be nice to have shift+insert or Ctrl+shift+insert to have a linux like feeling or ctrl+shift+c and ctrl+shift+v like powershell does 

91 :  I apologise if I've misread any of the code. 

92 :  feel free to point out what I said that was even remotely an attack on *anyone* or an assumption of motivations? 

93 :  I shouldn't have even posted the above, but I couldn't resist throwing my two cents in - sorry! 

94 :  I worry about the racial discrimination have happened in US from long time ago to recent as a human being, while I also insist to regard `blacklist, whitelist, blackbox testing, whitebox testing, master, slave, etc` to be neutral nouns in `IT area` as a software engineer. 

95 :  Indeed, that shows my attitude about racial discrimination and mercy about people who suffer from brutality all around the world. 

96 :  Don't let word game anesthetize us, If everyone pays attention, discrimination will slowly disappear, but if we pretend that it has disappeared now, it may exist forever, The more one tries to hide, the more one is exposed. 

97 :  Whatever your strategic decision for Godot is, it's totally legit. I'm here only to defend bgfx from false statements. 

98 :  Imploring maintainers of an open source software is not going to yield the best results, I think. 

99 :  Don't forget about those instagals! :dancer: 

100 :  stop trying to read the motivations of someone you don't know. 

101 :  I'm happy to keep the discussion going, so don't take this as a negative sign. 

102 :  Follow the steps and put this script tag in the head tag. I'm not sure what else Yandex needs, but this is generally how google adsense works. 

103 :  we want to also be kind in how we request help from the core maintainers of Gatsby. 

104 :  Try to push the cause in Seattle ,) 

105 :  there is a lot of politics behind all these huge software/hardware infrastructures... :-( 

106 :  By soon", do you mean before ______? ( _insert funny sarcasm here_ )." 

107 :  I do hope they are working on a hip backend, not a full fork. That would be sad and only split the working effort. 

108 :  Sorry if the above came out sounding rude, just trying to clarify my position above! 

109 :  This is not Twitter or your Facebook wall... :-) 

110 :  I'm very sad about the abandon of GPU support for macOS. 

111 :  Using GPU acceleration locally on my MacBook Pro or future iMac Pro would be awesome. 

112 :  (yeah, the syntax looks like some sort of incantations or something ,-)) 

113 :  Sorry, nevermind. I made a mess out of it :D. My config was not in order, 

114 :  I'm not a Webpack guru myself 

115 :  So many different solutions, so many different workable options, yet none of them helped me in the past 3 hours getting bootstrap up and running... 

116 :  stop wasting our time. 

117 :  This is the worst framework i have ever seen. 

118 :  I have real project with Angular, and the only thing i get while developing - is the hurting. Tons of hurt i get. 

119 :  when you deal with real big scale project - the hurt is the only thing you get. 

120 :  Go home 

121 :  Let's not make the person who runs a massive open source project almost by himself job harder than it needs to be 

122 :  I read you... I am a Software Engineer, I am that senior level guy you speak of... I have cried out Angular pains in the past. 

123 :  So, sorry I don't have small debate points and I don't blame you for having your point of view. 

124 :  I feel your points. They burn us, too. 

125 :  My hope is that the team gets back to productive boosting features as soon as the dirty plumbing is done. And no need for another major rewrite (Router4?) 

126 :  I hope in the future Angular will become even better and easier to understand. 

127 :  I will step away and unfollow understanding how my mouth often gets me in trouble. 

128 :  make sure that even if using `vh`/`vw` etc, that there's a component for font sizing tied to something else like `px`/`rem`/`em`. 

129 :  I am really sorry if I break any rules. 

130 :  I'm struggling about passive reaction of Flutter team. 

131 :  feel misled because everything I first saw on homepage etc, promised 60 FPS and native performance. I think its bordering on unethical to not make this problem clearly known to new developers. 

132 :  I wish it was paid so we would not get the its free, whatever you get be happy response. 

133 :  At least we would not get a 100 line code commit after 1 year on such a huge issue. 

134 :  So there's nothing concrete that's being done yet? 

135 :  Are there really users that like to keep tabs only on specific parts, like indent? 

136 :  I'd like to voice my displeasure towards two trends going on in Visual Studio editor since VS 2015 

137 :  Finally, I'd appreciate if there was some workaround for this spaces instead of tabs issue, it's driving me nuts. 

138 :  Shouldn't the above satisfy everyone involved? 

139 :  Maybe that is somehow my fault because English is not my primary language and what I wrote is hard to understand, but in all honesty I am not sure what are you arguing for (or against). 

140 :  I am really surprised to hear that something like that cannot be done while still keeping all current options. 

141 :  I'm happy to clarify any of my points. 

142 :  If you'd like another venue to discuss things (perhaps in realtime) I'm also happy to use gitter or discord to continue the discussion :) 

143 :  it may be what you want, but it may be wrong for other users complaining about something similar. 

144 :  I certain see how it can be a bug. 

145 :  Unfortunately though, we've now had this new system a long time, and we are wary about subjecting people to more potential changes in behavior, esp. as it might fix this issue, only to cause problems for others :-/ 

146 :  I don't disagree with that, but there seems to be great resistance to even acknowlege that the behaviour has changed at some point, and that it doesn't seem correct, from a users point of view, that selecting **Always keep TABs** means **Always keep TABs except sometimes they will be changed to spaces** 

147 :  I don't disagree with that, 

148 :  If i've missed any points, i apologize. 

149 :  There's a lot being discussed here, and i likely missed it. 

150 :  I totally get that that can be frustrating. 

151 :  A group of people (that you are not a part of) is having their needs met, while yours are not. 

152 :  However, this really is a space where potential changes risk very bad outcomes for many groups. 

153 :  Again, I'm happy to help clarify any of my statements, or address any points i may have missed. 

154 :  I apologize for being rude 

155 :  At this point I am discouraged to report more because nothing ever seems to get fixed (usually because it's complicated")." 

156 :  I hope you prove me wrong and actually fix this issue, but I won't be holding my breath. 

157 :  I apologize in advance for the offtopic 

158 :  It is, lets say, disappointing that it sounds like Microsoft can't maintain it's code because it is too complex. 

159 :  If you just told me that this shouldn't be addressed because I was a nobody and my opinion wasn't important, I'd be annoyed, certainly, but overall less concerned. 

160 :  change the example 

161 :  give keybox to me now 

162 :  roll your own, pick another technology, or pay the bill. 

163 :  This makes it harder for newcomers to learn aspnet core without the support from the community or microsoft officially 

164 :  If you want to give us feedback on the pricing and explain your situation, this is not the right place to do that. 

165 :  I completely get that the IS devs neeed more money and want to be paid. 

166 :  I'm disappointed that such a basic functionality now requires lots of unplanned work and time. 

167 :  That's really sad. 

168 :  I'm not the guy who can actually judge what you're doing and why 

169 :  somehow like the whole OpenSource-Idea, no? ,) 

170 :  One must learn to pick his fights, so to speak. :) 

171 :  I'm sorry for any distress this experience has caused you. 

172 :  This feature should not be default, this should remain optional until all supported browsers handle it. 

173 :  please correct me if my assumption was incorrect 

174 :  I believe that, in this case, inclusive" means ~"how welcome someone ***feels*** in the angular community." The poster is _telling us_ that, in at least one case, someone doesn't feel like the angular community is inclusive." 

175 :  It also makes clear that, as a community, we do care about how welcome people feel and our issue is not with the _intent_ of the original post (to be more inclusive and thoughtful), but rather the execution. 

176 :  this seems to boil down to what percentage of the community/potential community might interpret `ng` as a slur."" 

177 :  bolster their suggestion by providing more examples or reasons why the interpretation the girl had is actually generally applicable. 

178 :  If I were evaluating this issue, I wouldn't care how many people interpret `ng-repeat` the way I intended, I'm interested in how many people interpret `ng-repeat` the way I *didn't* intend. 

179 :  Because of this, this issue strikes me as providing valuable feedback and I would encourage people to surface similar experiences that they may have had. 

180 :  I'm sorry to hear about your experience and I understand the sensitivity of your concern. 

181 :  Let us take some time to consider your request and respond in a mindful way. 

182 :  It was never our intention 

183 :  we will be very mindful of this problem when creating future APIs 

184 :  We the Angular team, strongly believe in building an inclusive community where everyone feels welcome, and we see how especially ng-repeat could be problematic in certain scenarios. 

185 :  Did you dislike the idea of solving it via a tickable option in the Options window? 

186 :  If the idea of putting it in the Options window is rejected, then I'm trying to brainstorm an alternative solution 

187 :  I personally don't feel like it's worth fixing myself, but i'd be happy to help you with a PR to change if it is something that is affecting you. 

188 :  Two minds being better than one and all that :) 

189 :  If that changes in the future, let me know. 

190 :  My offers of assistance seem to not be welcome 

191 :  It'd be great if a future version of Windows Terminal baked this in by default across all shells - it's really useful to have 

192 :  You can squint and imagine a merged feature that serves all the scenarios. 

193 :  It is very disappointed 

194 :  I've started thinking that Microsoft consider community opinion ... I am very disappointed 

195 :  I think to make right decision for this feature is to create a poll and ask people will they use this feature and would not be it annoying that exist two solutions: static methods and free functions ... 

196 :  And that's also normal that people who against it would like to have more acceptable reasoning or possibility of rethinking 

197 :  when I say stop with ... I really mean that _we're the ones responsible, at the end of the day._ Sorry about that, it sounded bad on a re-read. 

198 :  a few people have been asking me today about pip install 32 bit tensorflow support. 

199 :  Having the same problem here. Would really appreciate a fix 

200 :  then I am going to stop supporting Tensoeflow. 

201 :  We would appreciate a python 32bit fix, some distros install python 32 bit by default and there's no way around it 

202 :  A lot of my clients asking for this too. would appreciate a fix 

203 :  another one just asked me for a fix -_- 

204 :  more people have asked me private for a fix today 

205 :  Don't underestimate how difficult things like this are from a theoretical perspective. 

206 :  Lots of people here manage to be constructive and positive and I'd appreciate your effort in not starting fights with us or other contributors. 

207 :  Go and learn some manners! 

208 :  I've read about observable something, but why would I use the whole framework if I had to use another framework and do my own implementation? 

209 :  If they make fool of me it's not my fault 

210 :  So this means the whole framework is unpolished, untested and lazy coded. 

211 :  clearly you are feeling frustrated and angry right now. I can understand how that can happen. 

212 :  It is important that we work constructively to solve our problems and not resort to insults. 

213 :  I'm very sorry if this will cause you to leave Godot. 

214 :  I understand that some black people may not consider these terms offensive, but I would rather someone not want to work with me because they think I am too politically correct than because they think I am too insensitive and blind. 

215 :  Of course, if you @trivikr personally feel strongly about this then I support you :] 

216 :  If there's another way for this to work, I'm open to alternate ideas, but I think conditionally playbook imports would be generically useful. 

217 :  Please use the‘  button to let the maintainers know you need this feature. Getting a ton of emails from these +1s. 

218 :  I think you have a legitimate concern and I'm sorry if you feel like I'm ignoring you. 

219 :  I think you have a legitimate concern and I'm sorry if you feel like I'm ignoring you. 

220 :  do not you think that simply stating that I 'messed up writers" ' without explaining why is rude?" 

221 :  Look again, the name isn't Maui, the name is Multi-platform App UI which abbreviates to M.A.U.I. 

222 :  I hope this is not Microsoft's general attitude towards open source projects these days... 

223 :  bro I am an Open Source author and maintainer so don't try lecturing me about being against off-putting towards the open-source community"" 

224 :  That's not because others really love .NET, but because they try to stay constructive here. 

225 :  MauiKit whether you want to hear it or not has no fundamentals of what I as an Open Source Author and Maintainer would consider signs of a healthy project. 

226 :  We are talking about open source projects, there should be a common philosophy, not a competition for those who have the biggest issue counter. 

227 :  Sorry if I sounded harsh, that wasn't my intent. 

228 :  To be honest, this entire thread so far makes me far less inclined to introduce a dependency on the enterprise project. 

229 :  will have to move to a real open source tool like JMeter instead of gatling.  Sad. 

230 :  We are really sorry to hear this. 

231 :  Don't be so agitated 

232 :  For best outcome please consider writing your messages mindfully and calmly explaining both your problem and what is the suggested resolution or expectation for it. 

233 :  My sincere apologies.  I was in the wrong, and I've done you harm.  I'm sorry. 

234 :  Alex, sorry, I had gathered that you're recognized as the principle Windows maintainer. I didn't mean to invent a title. 

235 :  Well, I'm sorry for having been slightly edgy due to the total irrelevance of that statement with which he accompanies the news that he unblocked me. 

236 :  Let's be clear - you're telling *me* that I don't credit trade-offs or drawbacks, on a project I maintain, for a protocol that was designed a year ago, and for which noone has reported any automated breakage of any system, while still being able to migrate at the time of their choice. 

237 :  It's also been frustrating to be treated as a troll when I was called entitled but responded with a compliment. 

238 :  It was frustrating to see my point be misinterpreted as something else. 

239 :  I'm sorry if you felt your concern wasn't taken into consideration, I think it's simply because you believe, as you said, making future decisions based on trust is a mistake", while other people may not (I don't)." 

240 :  Think about that. 

241 :  I read some thoughtful and reasonable responses in this thread, and I understand how everyone has their point of view. 

242 :  Stop whining about that and remove the BLM from the site. 

243 :  grow some thicker skin and calm down. 

244 :  As a side note, the kind of errors hit by the users on the thread of this issue (lack of basic knowledge of Python for instance) tells me that we cannot solve their problem. 

245 :  He, being one of the top contributors to scikit-learn has to make tough decisions as to what will go into our codebase and what will not, as a more verbose documentation or tutorial might not be preferable for a lot of people. 

246 :  we understand your eagerness to solve your problem, and your frustration when it is not solved. 

247 :  I am very new in scikit-learn. 

248 :  I will be highly appreciated any useful advice. 

249 :  Sorry if this issue seems a bit salty, but it's really annoying 

250 :  I just lost hours worth of state because of this behavior. 

251 :  Just having automatic updates install upon next launch would be a perfectly fine behavior 

252 :  Unfortunately I am going to have to abandon it until this issue is fixed because I'm losing a lot of time and work every other week when an update is pushed and my long-running processes are lost. 

253 :  Don't act on theories! 

254 :  This is the second or third time I've been screwed over by Microsoft's shitty installation practices. 

255 :  The grass isn't greener on the other side... 

256 :  To be fair, @jeremylt, the 300hrs estimate was quite demotivating for me when I started. 

257 :  I don't believe anything I've said could fairly be labeled mansplaining, but I am sorry that I was curt 

258 :  This mistake is still haunting us years later, unfortunately. 

259 :  It's sad that I have to use such a long winded approach to try and defend its future and get certain parts of Microsoft to cooperate with other parts. 

260 :  Replace the template text and remove irrelevant text as the instruction says. 

261 :  I think it is more important that the main developer of Vim can concentrate on enhancing and improving Vim instead of having to change a workflow, that has been proven to be working well for the past 30 years. 

262 :  My words were met by defensiveness, ego, stubbornness, ignorance, and delusion. 

263 :  Starting a reply with the conversation is already over is not okay. 

264 :  Check out the web service to see how they want you to do it. If it's your own server, set it up properly. 

265 :  Make up your mind, updater… 

266 :  Have patience 

267 :  doesn't hurt to be polite. 

268 :  fork it, fix it, make a pull request and contribute. 

269 :  It seems here that Microsoft is taking an active approach to kill VB actively (as opposed to passive approach - just let it die by abandoning it). :-( 

270 :  I probably shouldn't make any more PR as they will fail. 

271 :  I feel my time creating that PR was wasted, so not rewarding, hence I'll think twice before making another PR. 

272 :  I feel my time creating that PR was wasted, so not rewarding, hence I'll think twice before making another PR. 

273 :  I'm sorry I don't have much time for other things beside work and family. 

274 :  I didn't realize a 4 line PR would pull me into a discussion on how to improve it by implementing a new code base and consequently figure why shippable would fail. 

275 :  I didn't realize a 4 line PR would pull me into a discussion on how to improve it by implementing a new code base and consequently figure why shippable would fail. 

276 :  Feel free do whatever you see fit, I'm off to other things, good luck & sorry for the noise. 

277 :  Feel free do whatever you see fit, I'm off to other things, good luck & sorry for the noise. 

278 :  I think it really has to do with time of day, traffic, alignment of the planets, etc. 

279 :  Sooooooooooooooo slowly :( 

280 :  My apologies for the frustration this issue has caused. 

281 :  It would be helpful if you could benchmark this with curl for reference. 

282 :  i wish Salt guys put the comments inside this source, listing all the bugs related to this module. 

283 :  i made quite many changes in that mounts.py - and now i am thinking about undoing almost all of them... Lack of any documentation... 

284 :  See... i know very little about Linux and nothing about Python, so i was googling everything i could think of :-) 

285 :  it is sad how fast you were to say Salt is all wrong and how protective you fet about OMV. 

286 :  Our customers have complained after opening the application for the first time :( 

287 :  Disappointing that this is not being considered high priority. 

288 :  Honestly, this issue made me re-consider of cross-platform frameworks being owned by the same company (Google here) will be supported at best, and ignoring quality metrics delivery on other platforms (iOS). 

289 :  The project needs lifesaving measures as it's community is dissatisfied enough to be discussing forks. 

290 :  Issues where opened and closed by the bot without any reponse, and nobody but you can do some critical things (merging pull requests, publishing fixes...). 

291 :  I hope people keep that vision in mind, when considering the near-term goals like providing prompt feedback directly on GitHub discussions, quick resolution for user-contributed PRs, maintenance releases etc. 

292 :  I do continue to feel pretty disappointed that the active project ownership that is so badly is still not coming in the near term. 

293 :  I agree your mind but really sad about results...  :-| 

294 :  PS : sorry for my poor english, frenchies are really bad with it :-) 

295 :  I love you Jack, for making SUI. I just hope you dont get crazy <3 

296 :  At the same time I must mention one thing: **you will not succeed on your own**. 

297 :  In that regard I find it highly confusing - and disrespectful imho - that you chose to ignore all suggestions to delegate power to trusted contributors who would like to help you to maintain SUI 2.x. 

298 :  PS: You will still be the captain ,) 

299 :  If you're just going to hack around with low level packets, then just use netty and don't bother us when things break. 

300 :  I understand that it won't be accepted, I'm not contesting that. 

301 :  be kind 

302 :  As a consumer of your product, I expect it to work as advertised 

303 :  So our apologies if some things take too long, or don't end up happening 

304 :  but it's wrong to blame the maintainers for this. 

305 :  Well I'm having trouble making a reproducer for this. 

306 :  it would be great if there was a built-in way to paginate a list Jekyll collection items on a page. 

307 :  it would be nice if there was a built in pagniation that worked for both post and collection items. 

308 :  would like to see Nested Collections. 

309 :  I would like to see [reading metadata in separate files] 

310 :  I would like to see the tags of collections included in site.tags. 

311 :  build in support for content blocks and components 

312 :  I'd very much love to have native support for Coffeescript in much the same manner as Sass. 

313 :  it would be great to have more interactions with github, like pulling profile information (contributions, avatar, ), releases data - and convert it for proper publication. 

314 :  I would like to see an automated tool like Webpack integrated into Jekyll to handle Sass and Javascript. 

315 :  I'd love to see Docker volume mounts work with Jekyll and Docker for Windows. 

316 :  I would love to see an offically supported page generator from data files. 

317 :  Make internal linking easier. 

318 :  Dont work with fb and google 

319 :  This is not the level of security awareness I expect Microsoft to have. 

320 :  work with your security teams to get the uploader qualified by at least the major vendors 

321 :  A company that does not understand the need of a full doc do not will offer a serious support in the long time 

322 :  Close this issue 

323 :  It would be nice to at least give an explanation before just closing an issue, this way nothing will get resolved, 

324 :  It would be nice to at least give an explanation before just closing an issue, this way nothing will get resolved, 

325 :  Wondering if Terminal users are mentally prepared to such amount of social activity in their lives.. switching from 0 social life to this directly might be... Overwhelming 

326 :  It's a fun-take and I wanted to upvote it for the fun part, but then I thought it may send the wrong message so I had to downvote it, just to not confuse newcomers. ,) 

327 :  The removal of the santa hat, and kowtowing to a fake user, is incredibly offensive to me. 

328 :  When I updated my VSCode, it was gone. 

329 :  If you don't do it I'll feel sad and disappointed. 

330 :  I'm deeply sorry for my insensitivity. 

331 :  Bring back the Santa's hat! 

332 :  I liked the santa hat, it brought a little joy to my day. Very sad that it has been removed. 

333 :  bring the hat back 

334 :  Bring back the hat. 

335 :  Put a satan hat back. 

336 :  add a Satan Hat! 

337 :  Assuming he was trolling: troll successful, gg 

338 :  I'm also not happy that the santa hat was removed, completely ignoring the public opinion here on GH. 

339 :  I def understand how frustrated you are, but every new platform has its shares of issues and stability. 

340 :  I understand you're frustrated, but having a positive attitude, even when you're stressed out or frustrated speaks volumes to others who are genuinely trying to help. 

341 :  Instead, when are you going to add REAL support for streaming?? 

342 :  I'm almost 40, and I bet I'm gonna die BEFORE you even get the idea to implement all of this!!! Pfffff............... 

343 :  that is painful 

344 :  Embrace the patterns of the npm ecosystem. 

345 :  Could you show me how to resolve this issue please? 

346 :  fork lerna and do it yourself. 

347 :  what a waste of time. 

348 :  We are talking things technically, don't make it personal. 

349 :  Calm down 

350 :  If you feel disrespect on nasty", I apologize." 

351 :  I think, you have many professional developers and why this F... RTL problem is not important for you? 

352 :  Why atom team don't like to fix this issue? 

353 :  Microsoft products are phenomenally bad and it's a wonder how you guys still stay in business. 

354 :  I suspect your whiteboarding hiring technique is ineffective and counterproductive. 

355 :  What's so special about installing .NET Core that it requires a different installation strategy? 

356 :  WTF? 

357 :  GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER MICROSOFT!!!! 

358 :  If I sound harsh, it's because I am sick and tired of Microsoft releasing half-baked products that don't work as expected. 

359 :  I would feel sorry for you guys like I would for the slow kid who klutzes around the basketball court, but this isn't your first time on the court with years of effort and tons of resources. 

360 :  It's why your own developers are using MacBook Pros for development. 

361 :  Telling us you are frustrated is fine, ranting is not. 

362 :  This is the kind of coding quality we get when corporations prioritizes employee diversity over code quality 

363 :  A thumbs down isn't enough on this one. There's zero tolerance for backwater attitude. Reporting. 

364 :  If people like me and you don't attempt it then we can wait another 3 years without anyone else picking the issue up. 

365 :  I am frankly fed up with this posture in open source projects. 

366 :  I've abandoned (a long time ago) the port effort and don't even use Dart anymore and will stop watching this rep. 

367 :  Why would I post this on the community site? I'm experiencing this problem on the travis-ci.com website?? 

368 :  you are showing how unappreciative and ignorant you can be. 

369 :  You can fault the devs for not getting this right with modules from the start, but aside from that, you should have more awareness of reality and what these changes have required before sharing those types of crass comments. 

370 :  In fact, you should probably not use any open source software, as the type of comment you left above are one of the major reasons why application developers give up on open source. 

371 :  Just because the software is open source doesn't mean we aren't paying for it. 

372 :  I honestly cannot believe how casual and dismissive you guys at MS are. 

373 :  I understand it must really difficult to do your job as a $1.75T company but can you try? 

374 :  Seeing you are happy to close issues and never respond to replies in closed issues, I am forced to open new issue. 

375 :  I would like to remind you that we are a small team of maintainers, and it has been less than or barely 24 hours since I responded to your issue yesterday. 

376 :  Telling users that they can use DSX but can't use debugger or enjoy auto-complete is a non starter for me. 

377 :  you are mixing everything I say and this conversation is going nowhere. In legal terms you are Badgering the witness"." 

378 :  I just don't have the time for this here. 

379 :  You failed to grasp that XML parsing (with some extra code to skip '{}' properly) is orders of magnitude simpler than fully parsing a programming language like Dart. 

380 :  you should invest you time and energy in writing up convincing arguments. 

381 :  You guys are suffering from NIH syndrome (Not-invented-here). Good artists copy, great artists steal", mediocre artists, well, behave like you." 

382 :  Really !!! nobody seems to bother to explain what exactly Flutter would gain... blah blah blah"." 

383 :  I don't want to argue against the feature but comments like if you don't do x then horribly y will happen" are just ridiculous." 

384 :  I think you underestimate how willing people are to try things, even when they're not fully polished. 

385 :  Obviously you didn't take my hint on length to heart but don't come to conclusions about my character because you don't know me at all. 

386 :  It is obvious to me that you are not very experienced with JSX, you really don't understand how it works. 

387 :  You are not the meter used to measure success and you don't know what I am up to. 

388 :  You equate me not having much experience with JSX and me not knowing how it works at all? 

389 :  my point still stands - that kind of comment is _still_ not appropriate here. 

390 :  Women can also be a construction worker  

391 :  This is the worst piece of advice anyone can give. 

392 :  Are you a I am the greatest dev alive" guy?" 

393 :  because if you even pause for a second to contemplate yes to any of those things you have a very rude awakening coming. 

394 :  It would also have been nice if you gave some actual reasoning behind your comment, not just flaming. 

395 :  I think I would rather become a rice farmer than ever touch WCF again. 

396 :  This is another good reason to not support WCF. Years of people implementing designs using WCF based on false assumptions or mythical functionality. 

397 :  If you don't like it, don't use it!!! 

398 :  Why try and stop others from using it? and most importantly why do so with absolutely no information just flaming? sorry but show me, tell me why? 

399 :  So, if this way of doing things is so terrible tell me why, don't just talk smack. Facts, Proof, Scientific Method... 

400 :  **I ask kindly post something informative and factual or just stop trolling.** 

401 :  Berating them to move to REST when it's impossible for them is neither clever nor helpful. 

402 :  This was last discussed more than five years ago and should be discussed again. 

403 :  for support reasons, you don't really have to ask what platform they're on, just mention the three paths in one sentence, it's actually rather easy. 

404 :  You're being a bit facetious. 

405 :  The third silly thing is that you're acting like IPython doesn't have any changes that break some pieces of code or tutorials out there. 

406 :  All in all it makes your comment seem more like irrational stubbornness than actual concerns. 

407 :  There's no need to update all the code and documentation all over the internet", nobody has every done that and never will." 

408 :  Now if it's to criticize the code without proper understanding of the technical and social reason of why it is the way it is, and bring XDG zealotry into the mix, I'm even less likely to make an effort. 

409 :  Also, your explanation still makes zero sense It's just re-identify the id if change" isn't even a proper sentence." 

410 :  Listen to his comment and stop suggesting this crudely thought-up bandaid of a fix"." 

411 :  Just PLEASE STOP. 

412 :  Care to explain why did you deleted my comment? 

413 :  Because it was completely inappropriate. Telling other contributors to not comment because you have no clue what you're talking about" is toxic behavior." 

414 :  Telling other contributors to not comment because you have no clue what you're talking about" is toxic behavior." 

415 :  While your contributions are clearly valuable, you need to accept that you're part of a larger community and need to treat others with respect. 

416 :  As such I don't care about what the code of conduct says because anyway I don't plan to contribute more work to this OSS project. 

417 :  Well, I consider his behavior to show a lack of respect for other's people work and time. 

418 :  Well, I appreciate they're appreciated but at the same time I don't really care. 

419 :  Nobody appreciates random/out of context quoting, straightforward answer avoidance, jumping to conclusions and whatnot. 

420 :  Working for fun doesn't imply that you get to do whatever you want and that there are no consequences. 

421 :  You shield yourself in the code of conduct and go OMG, how could people dare telling me that I'm wrong? 

422 :  Or perhaps you try to do better next time and avoid the not so fun part of messing up? 

423 :  And if you really do not know what you are talking about then what? 

424 :  Instead of an answer I've got some gibberish that tries to pass as code review or whatever that is supposed to be. 

425 :  It's exactly this unwillingness to learn from mistakes that brought us here. 

426 :  Feel free to continue to go down this path, the only thing you'll achieve is to dig the hole deeper. 

427 :  Yet here you are, telling me exactly that. 

428 :  Telling him that he doesn't know what he's talking about is unacceptable. 

429 :  If you want other people to learn, you need to give them more information beyond you're wrong"." 

430 :  You're basically sending him the signal of you're not welcome here"." 

431 :  if we observe behavior like this in the future, we'll ultimately block you. 

432 :  We can't have other contributors stop engaging with us because of your behavior. While your contributions are valued, they don't warrant losing other contributors as collateral damage. 

433 :  But instead of apologizing or even just letting that feedback sink in, you're now trying to turn the tables by saying you got victimized by Tanner because he asked you a technical question and that it's unreasonable from our end to ask you to be respectful in your responses to him. 

434 :  But instead of apologizing or even just letting that feedback sink in, you're now trying to turn the tables by saying you got victimized by Tanner because he asked you a technical question and that it's unreasonable from our end to ask you to be respectful in your responses to him. 

435 :  Oh, you gotta be joking. 

436 :  If you do not follow - can you ask other collaborators for help? 

437 :  Great attitude, especially as a _fastlane_ collaborator. Why not say it in here publicly? 

438 :  So instead of having a discussion and providing a counter example or presenting **any** reasoning why something would not be implemented, you are just discouraging people from helping _fastlane_... 

439 :  This is highly inappropriate. 

440 :  Do you really wonder why I don't want to spend any more time helping you? 

441 :  Mentioning other contributors that have not participated in the discussion is inappropriate as well, by the way. 

442 :  I do not think that looking for help in other contributors was inappropriate in that case as you clearly didn't want to take care of this issue. 

443 :  If people started paying for packages then they would be a lot more careful about the crap they select. 

444 :  YOU choose to spend your time on this project. 

445 :  If you aren't willing to contribute your code or your ideas to open source and aren't willing to contribute to projects monetarily, you should consider tempering your views. 

446 :  You guys seriously don't see what this guy is doing? He's trying to push his ESLint config as a standard" and monetize it." 

447 :  Not when that feedback is 100% predicable because it's nothing but our inner two year old being triggered to whine when everything doesn't go 100% his or her way. 

448 :  To place a copyleft licence on the work and then complain that you can't monetize it because people are copying it for free is an... interesting complaint. 

449 :  What an awful and misleading name for a eslint config. 

450 :  No, not all humans have this reaction.  The reaction you are projecting on all humans infers that all humans are greedy, inconsiderate thieves. 

451 :  Not letting your inner two year old rule you does not mean he is not present.  His complaints are predictable, and those who are voicing complaints from him are not needed. 

452 :  Please take your pseudo-intellectual garbage elsewhere 

453 :  Calling people triggered whining two-year olds doesn't contribute to this discussion constructively. 

454 :  should be ashamed of himself. 

455 :  It would be appreciable and civilized if you stopped calling the other's point of view &mdash, or the point of view you think they hold &mdash, stupid"." 

456 :  It would be appreciable and civilized if you stopped calling the other's point of view &mdash, or the point of view you think they hold &mdash, stupid"." 

457 :  Even worse, you don't seem to try to understand the other side point of view, and rush to your own conclusions. 

458 :  You move from **assumptions**,  **contracts** to **communicating**. 

459 :  Comparisons to Hitler are neither necessary nor welcome here, and anyone unable to debate the merits of *versioning schemes* without relying on that as a rhetorical device should rethink whether their participation here is going to lead to a constructive conversation. 

460 :  Is Microsoft's official answer to reporting a serious performance regression in a subsystem used every day by developers and admins who are managing and maintaining their user base really yeah we are aware of it but whether we will fix it and when, who knows"?" 

461 :  if you're unhappy with how the console is performing, go ahead and switch back to legacy mode. 

462 :  Don't struggle with this, Mike.  Again, if your mythical twenty year old stuff" doesn't work with the new Windows 10 console, by all means, use the old console, link in ANSICON, and keep relying on monkeypatching GetProcAddress (euughhhh)." 

463 :  In other words you want someone else to do the work for you „ 

464 :  You got the report and the working samples. 

465 :  So in your opinion you're free to mess it up, isn't it? 

466 :  Grow up first! 

467 :  Please stop collecting MY data and remove telemetry from all your f**g Windows products. 

468 :  Be thankful. Microsoft uses the data to improve your calculating experience. :smile: 

469 :  Just hoping Microsoft will not put backdoor, telemetry, obfuscation and all its shit in all Github projects, like others did in SourceForge. 

470 :  Just because a product is open-sourced doesn't mean you can go around making demands in this manner. 

471 :  I don't respect people who want to collect my PRIVATE data with software. 

472 :  If you don't like my demand, delete it. 

473 :  If you want better software, delete all these malwares. 

474 :  Because everybody today is speaking on the Net about a Windows Calculator with telemetry inside. I didn't believe even that was possible and... yes. 

475 :  What isn't respectful is polluting the issue-catalog with useless rants, poorly hidden profanity and shouting. 

476 :  I am, however, done with this issue now. 

477 :  you guys are worried about what data the calculator is collecting? what about the rest of windows lol 

478 :  You are not Calculator King of the Internet. 

479 :  A lot of time is being wasted doing what I've already done. 

480 :  The only negative opinions I get are from trolls or people who need an excuse for why they suck at the game. 

481 :  I do NOT need to upgrade, you miss the point. 

482 :  Avoiding Win10 is intentional, because I don't want my PC to have buggy, ugly, spying rubbish. 

483 :  I however suspect your comments are a little disingenuous 

484 :  you are entitled to believe what you like, but Windows 7 is coming to an end, and if you do not wish to remain a Windows user, there is macOS and various forms of Linux, for you to choose from. 

485 :  This isn't some Reddit thread for you to vent. 

486 :  Shortly, it's THE WORST system MS made (after Millenium). 

487 :  That's why I feel disappointed(angry) that you support Win10 and WITHOUT ANY REASON drop support for Win7. 

488 :  And funny, but NOT A SINGLE ANSWER were given by... hm... professionals"." 

489 :  You really need to take a step back and consider how you present yourself publicly. 

490 :  I have no desire to provide a professional response based on your attitude. 

491 :  This is absolutely unacceptable behavior 

492 :  Whoever came up with this idea clearly doesn't understand why ESLint was created in the first place. 

493 :  There are plenty of domains where you would like to give a function a name beginning with use"." 

494 :  You're not paying for it and the maintainers of this tool don't owe you anything. 

495 :  When you do post a complaint, you'll maximize your chances of getting what you want by avoiding incendiary language like absolutely unacceptable", "screaming", "atrocious", "carelessly", and "doesn't understand"." 

496 :  what's fuck google do? flutter is yours,golang is yours, why can't they live together? 

497 :  @akien-mga and other contributors.. get your shit together 

498 :  Whether it was a mistake or not is not decided by you, but the community as a whole. 

499 :  You are not the center of the universe. 

500 :  I have no idea what you are so angry about, just chill man. 

501 :  the only way someone can convince someone else to work on something on this project is good arguments from one side and the will to do it from the other side. 

502 :  you come off as quite hostile. 

503 :  I feel like I've seen you troll (that's what your comments amount to really) other GitHub projects also but I won't bother to check. Life is too short‹» 

504 :  you also completely dodged my point about the smiley emoji implementations. so i recommend a good feature for the engine **(inventory and other 2d stuff, that ALL GAME DEVELOPERS WILL BENEFIT FROM)**, but **you spit in my face**, claim that it's not low level enough", but then go around merging PRs for "emoji smiley" support for fonts? that's somehow still low level though? wtf??" 

505 :  so much for open source"." 

506 :  wtf?? 

507 :  can't have discussions without bypassing  / cheating github it seems! 

508 :  it's really hard for me to sit back and ignore what these companies are doing with my code. 

509 :  I have trouble expressing how angry this makes me feel. 

510 :  Do parents" who drag their children across the desert with the express intent of illegally entering the United States have no share of blame for what happens to these children?" 

511 :  It says nothing about people giving money to e.g. Microsoft or using Microsoft products. 

512 :  Maybe they would have dropped in to tell us it won't be accepted and not to waste any effort on it? 

513 :  go listen to them and stop relying on those soulless motherfuckers at Facebook to give a damn about you. 

514 :  to be honest, this response is borderline unacceptable and I don't even know what to reply. Wow. 

515 :  What the actual hell is your goal here? 

516 :  You're screwing Lerna, not the companies listed 

517 :  Meanwhile you're getting massive community backlash that's only going to continue if you decide to be a child and inappropriately release this as a minor version bump or with the MIT license. 

518 :  The best thing feasible for Lerna at this point is you leaving the project 

519 :  The best thing feasible for Lerna at this point is you leaving the project 

520 :  the second best thing is everyone moving to a fork of the project without a politician having any control. 

521 :  The irony is I 100% agree with your politics, but this is not the place to express them. 

522 :  it sucks if I have to spend my evening checking a bunch of old repos because you'll _maybe_ release this as a patch. 

523 :  So I fucked off and told them to eat shit. 

524 :  Once upon a time I thought I had to go work for those big corporations that I hate in order to do the kind of open source work I want to do. That turned out to be incredibly false. So I fucked off and told them to eat shit. 

525 :  If you want to restrict who can use lerna, then lerna can no longer be called free, it will be proprietary. 

526 :  Calls for civility are perfectly apt after an issue like this. Suggesting that asking people to be nice" is an attempt at ending discussion is one of the strangest stretches I've ever heard. As someone that called maintainers cowards for reverting the changes and removing Jamie, I can get a strong sense of why you'd argue that point, however." 

527 :  do you really want transparency, or are you looking for a fight? 

528 :  If you're looking for rancorous sniping and harmful drama" you might try using a mirror." 

529 :  Explain how me, the person who made the decision, not employed by Microsoft, was secretly paid by Microsoft to ruin open source. Should be an amusing story. 

530 :  So for all this grandstanding you're doing -- why not delete your GitHub account...seriously -- MS will own GitHub soon. Also -- change your OS from Windows -- if you use that... 

531 :  Oh Jesus nevermind -- I'm an idiot I guess :joy: -- apologies :) 

532 :  Sure, I'm sure you could argue Adolf was a pretty cool guy if you ignore all the other stuff he did and just focus on his gun control policy. ”¥ 

533 :  This is really frustrating 

534 :  This is stupid! 

535 :  There is a bug here and posting that this is fixed is misleading. 

536 :  Honest question: does anybody read what I've been posting about this issue? 

537 :  Did you actually read the thread? 

538 :  The problem is nbot the ability to permanently remove files, please the first message of the issue... It's explicit. 

539 :  You assumed the most common error was because `gvfs-trash` was not installed. 

540 :  This thread is the proof it's no more the case. Please, update. 

541 :  I would direct people to actually read the bug report before commenting. 

542 :  Well great let me just ship your computer around so everyone can use it. 

543 :  Or even better we will buy everyone a plane ticket and then can come stand in line to use your computer where the software does work. 

544 :  I dont understand why people working for google have such a problem admting they make mistakes...  everybody does, what makes difference is fix them or not. 

545 :  i cant even imagine a meeting to present the product: Here we have a new tool that will allow developers to set constants remotelly, helping with A/B tests and allowing the developer to change apps behavior without re-deploy." 

546 :  You just told me that if someone has an app in both architectures and want to use the default values THIS PERSON MUST DEFINE EVERY FIELD 3 TIMES... does it sound smart? 

547 :  I hate to be rude and also hate to teach people how to do their jobs. but this architecture design of firebase RC is a clear mistake, anyone with a basic software engineer understand should be able to see that. 

548 :  I'm sorry to tell you but this isnt frustrating" this is a super stupid architecture design..." 

549 :  This is very much a case of Old Microsoft" rearing it's head, rather then new forward looking Microsoft." 

550 :  We can disagree here and have debates, but please halt yourself before assuming the motivations of others and attacking individuals personally or their work. 

551 :  If you're unhappy with them, you're absolutely free to change them. 

552 :  did you perhaps recognise the truth of what I wrote and felt defensive? 

553 :  I am so tempted to chime in with something more confrontational but I don't think it'll add to the debate 

554 :  if you expect it to meet all your needs straight away you probably need to realign your expectations. 

555 :  you're getting a little extreme. 

556 :  Good recommendation, but the you'll sound like Yoda" is too informal for a disclaimer." 

557 :  **I REALLY DISAGREE WITH THIS PR** 

558 :  This is actually nonsensical statement. 

559 :  you are being overly defensive when the whole argument was about Godot, not BGFX. 

560 :  You seem to be assuming that just because of adding BGFX support, everything will be fine and no one will ever have to learn how the underlying APIs work. 

561 :  thanks a lot for your enthusiasm, but I am the one doing the rendering work in Godot, not you. 

562 :  As always with Godot, you are free to make your own renderer with BGFX, show me that it's flawless, has better better performance, works better than mine (of course while supporting the full Godot feature set) and uses less resources and code to prove me wrong.. as well as commiting full time over the next years to maintain it. 

563 :  If you want a revolution, begin with it yourself. 

564 :  If you want to prove your ideas, invest in them because words are free. 

565 :  What a classic example of elitism and douchebaggery. 

566 :  I will stay miles away from Godot and any projects you maintain, thanks. 

567 :  I will stay miles away from Godot and any projects you maintain, thanks. 

568 :  Nobody's saying it shouldn't use the network. 

569 :  It just shouldn't use the network *before the user has given it permission*, because otherwise it is a **data leak**. 

570 :  That's *why the consent dialog exists*. 

571 :  That seems to be a recurring issue 

572 :  You need to reopen this one too, because, inconvenient or not, autoupdate checks are also an inadvertent form of telemetry *whether the project uses them for the purpose or not*. 

573 :  It doesn't matter if the telemetry is coming from the telemetry package" or not." 

574 :  As already stated, if that form of telemetry" is an issue for you feel free to block the network access or create a version of Atom that doesn't check for updates." 

575 :  What about the thousands of other users who haven't spent time and money on things like Little Snitch, who nevertheless don't want to be tracked and explicitly opt out of telemetry that still get telemetry sent (and logged by their government forever) against their wishes? 

576 :  If you're going to insist on the autoupdate thing, couldn't you just do it once per month, at a random number of cumulative hours delay (say, 1-12) after startup, so that it doesn't function as an ad hoc user has launched the app" telemetry event to everyone watching and logging the network?" 

577 :  If you're going to insist on the autoupdate thing, couldn't you just do it once per month, at a random number of cumulative hours delay (say, 1-12) after startup, so that it doesn't function as an ad hoc user has launched the app" telemetry event to everyone watching and logging the network?" 

578 :  As I have stated multiple times you can definitely work with Atom while offline (or with network requests blocked). 

579 :  I do think that while delivered in a dictatorial manner, comment is worth discussing more. 

580 :  Aww.. Here, have a beer on me: :beer: 

581 :  There is also room now to put Google Ads in the exception messages. 

582 :  If you, or somebody else, think Node.js *should* address one of the particular concerns, and are willing to help in making that happen, Im sure we can arrange that. :slightly_smiling_face: 

583 :  Largely a duplicate of #19826 from earlier this year.  The answer is still 'no'. 

584 :  If you don't have anything relevant to say, stay quiet 

585 :  Your heavy-handed and dismissive approach to moderation diminishes the project and the whole community. 

586 :  Just because you are afraid taking responsibility doesn't mean someone else won't step up to it. 

587 :  Just because you are afraid taking responsibility doesn't mean someone else won't step up to it. 

588 :  You suck at it. 

589 :  it's bullshit solution. 

590 :  It's hard to predict what you want, because it's not clear what you want. 

591 :  Jesus, I wish you guys STFU and get back to work instead. 

592 :  Too bad maintainers do not mute the thread. 

593 :  I'll have to unsubscribe from the ticket because it's unbearable to get emails with flame wars. 

594 :  I've been spending WAY too much time on adding bootstrap 4 with npm to a webpack project. 

595 :  I just installed, included, imported and my app just runs fine, no errors, but yet no col-md or container styling working.. meh, i'll just return to CDN's... 

596 :  But also, I don't want to be mean but I would prefer not to have this kind of discussions. 

597 :  This is once again NOT a bug and it is up to you to now change the way you deal with your animations. 

598 :  If you don't want to call it a bug, it's very bad design at the very least. 

599 :  I am **once again**, going to explain how the frame property works within the engine: you select a frame, which is numbered from left to right, then from top to bottom. 

600 :  And once again, there is nothing to fix here, unless you have a real solution" to the problem." 

601 :  we won't solve your problem by introducing workarounds in the code, sorry. 

602 :  What the hell? 

603 :  Your issue doesn't contain a single bit of useful information anybody could act on. 

604 :  At best the problem is that your expectations are wrong and you blame Angular instead of adjusting yourself, and the worse case is that you are just spreading spam. 

605 :  Angular works great for most. If it doesn't for you it's highly likely the problem is on your end. 

606 :  You need to stop acting like 3-year old. 

607 :  You need to stop acting like 3-year old. 

608 :  Grow up, get your sh*t together and stop spamming. 

609 :  don't cry, contributor, you are not blame that you are into that sh*t 

610 :  the reality is just opposite, it is the very suitable framework especially for real big projects. Just to guess, your problem is probably that you see it / try to use it by the same way as from jQuery point of view which is totally wrong way. 

611 :  whats the problem to answer this question? 

612 :  I don't even understand what the problem is and you don't seem to be interested to explain it. 

613 :  I don't even understand what the problem is and you don't seem to be interested to explain it. 

614 :  LOL - you simply closed my issue - where is your interest? 

615 :  LOL - you simply closed my issue - where is your interest? 

616 :  Because you do not know the answer about the raw response in gitter? 

617 :  I don't even care if that is directly in your code or was pulled in via a dependency bump. 

618 :  I'd say that's much worse than a temporarily broken build. 

619 :  I'm sorry my fuckups have caused you pain. 

620 :  And even if you do feel there is responsibility, you should not be so rude. 

621 :  Unintended breaking changes happen, but blaming it on the consumers is not an appropriate response. 

622 :  your reaction to the mistake being brought to your intention is somewhere between condescending and hostile. 

623 :  Instead you said that it's good that your mistake broke my build. 

624 :  You could have said sorry, this was not intended, let me roll back and re-release as 4.0.0" and it would be fine." 

625 :  You could have said sorry, I didn't consider that the yargs API practically becomes part of the lerna API, I will make sure that future SemVer major updates of yargs only happen in SemVer major updates of lerna"" 

626 :  However, I do see much evidence that you are trying to crash through head first through Angular and I see it as you feel it should just work the way you want it to... 

627 :  You either consume it all OR you will be wingin' it" and fighting the current of how things actually work versus how you want them to work." 

628 :  **angular team doesn't care about users feedback at all** 

629 :  Soooooooooooo youre setting Angular on fire and saying bold shit in bold like the Angular team dont care about you cause you found relative pathing has an issue is an odd area 

630 :  I felt Angular 2 to Angular 4 stuck it to me in the ace hole butttttttttttttt alas past my bitching, it all was for the better 

631 :  The topic here has just been a bunch of bitching where I have found success in the CLI and lazy loading. 

632 :  Im NOT going to create some plunked to split hairs with you 

633 :  Unprofessional for Flutter team to have this issue for more than 1 year. 

634 :  It is just shows up the whole Google company style - quantity over quality. 

635 :  may I remind you of the code of conduct of this repository which strongly encourages a kind behaviour? 

636 :  you are really think that is the Apple's problem? 

637 :  No one is even assigned to this issue yet? 

638 :  Guys from Flutter team, you spend tone of time to learn algorithms, data structure, low level programming for get work in Google and for now is it actually that type of solution you wanna provide being hired by the one of the best company in the world? Crutch? 

639 :  Guys from Flutter team, you spend tone of time to learn algorithms, data structure, low level programming for get work in Google and for now is it actually that type of solution you wanna provide being hired by the one of the best company in the world? Crutch? 

640 :  When you solve this issue(instead of provide workaround) Flutter will be best SaaS decision in the world, even for iOS users! 

641 :  I wonder why neither my proposal of shipping MSL nor the proposal of an optimisation run got a response from anyone from the team. 

642 :  Guys, I think we should start reaching out to the press about this issue. 

643 :  Ultimately the priorities of the flutter dev team are set by business stakeholders, I think. 

644 :  Show us ONE request from ANYONE who asked for their TABs to be changed to spaces within their code when using the option KEEP TABS. 

645 :  Come on people, this is not rocket science, it's a text editor for $(Deity)'s sake! 

646 :  Obviously it's more convient to blindly deny it here rather than simply fix it. 

647 :  How about not commenting before understanding what you read? 

648 :  You butted into the middle of a discussion by putting words in my mouth because you haven't bothered to understand what I wrote. 

649 :  So now you are implying that I don't even know what I want? 

650 :  What's next, telling me to get used to doing things your way because reasons? 

651 :  If this is a feature, and not a bug, then someone please explain why, when **Always keep TABs** is selected, these TABs are being replaced by Spaces? 

652 :  It's VERY unpredictable and frustrating. 

653 :  It may be worse for you, but better for others.  Hence the dilemma :) 

654 :  You'd see things very differently if on some lines of your code, your spaces were constantly being replaced by tabs. 

655 :  99% of what you wrote translates into excuses to not even attempt to change anything because something could break while at the same time you are totally disregarding that it has already been broken for us, hence the bug reports. 

656 :  99% of what you wrote translates into excuses to not even attempt to change anything because something could break while at the same time you are totally disregarding that it has already been broken for us, hence the bug reports. 

657 :  it is clear that you enjoy imposing your way on others given your ban on tabs" which you mentioned above." 

658 :  So far you have not addressed any of my points, instead you keep spouting some weird mix of anti-tab religious zealotry and corporate PR talk. 

659 :  At the risk of getting banned from commenting on this and every other Microsoft repo I am going to call you out on your bullshit -- you, Sir, are full of it and presenting rational arguments to you is a colossal waste of time. 

660 :  At the risk of getting banned from commenting on this and every other Microsoft repo I am going to call you out on your bullshit -- you, Sir, are full of it and presenting rational arguments to you is a colossal waste of time. 

661 :  i am out of here, and I will be advocating in my company to drop Visual Studio licensing. 

662 :  Maybe you will learn to honor user's preferences when they hit you in the wallet. 

663 :  It's open for God knows for how long just like this one. 

664 :  This misbehavior on tabs was reported shortly after the release of the VS2015 version, multiple times, by different people. 

665 :  You developed an new auto format engine and it fails to give the same good experience as the one that was used before and instead of fixing it, you prefer to spend hours of discussion with arguments that have nothing to do with the given issue. 

666 :  How much patience do you expect, by people that have to deal with this bug on every day? 

667 :  That is NOT expected behaviour. 

668 :  And today here we are approx. 6 years since the release of Visual Studio 2015 where the issue was introduced and you are telling me that you need more time to make sure someone is not negatively impacted while people using tabs are negatively impacted for 6 years and counting. 

669 :  I hope by now you are noticing a pattern, because the same kind of discussion is going on here as well. 

670 :  If you do bother to read those discussions as I asked you to, you will hopefully see how much of my personal time and effort I have spent on submitting the issue, and explaining things that Microsoft's own software engineers should have known better than me. 

671 :  In case what I am hinting at isn't clear, the difference is that I am a customer who is paying for the OS and dev tools licenses who is spending own free time to help improve things, and your colleagues are doing this on the salary and with this kind of response I am getting I have absolutely no incentive to contribute further. 

672 :  I have the urge to drop Microsoft products and suggest to the company I work for that we do the same wherever we can 

673 :  So no other editor exhibits this behaviour, no editor before 2015 exhibited this behaviour, people are here reporting it as a bug, but you're are suggesting that it fixed some problem endemic since the dawn of computing. 

674 :  That's bemusing to me, but if you're happy with it, then lucky you. 

675 :  Why It's not working? >:E There is no objective reasons for that. 

676 :  Do not distract me for this nonsense 

677 :  It would be much easier to understand if you simplified the example somewhat (remove the extra calls inside your auth service) and explained what you're actually looking for. 

678 :  This issue doesn't provide the steps to reproduce, or the exact expectation you're looking for with the example provided. 

679 :  i am from india my name is ramjeet widevin is shit .!! 

680 :  I'll be brief: It's because of guys like you that this device is being revoked. 

681 :  You - the person creating this issue is shit btw 

682 :  not widevine or the player, not even hiding the fact that you're using decryption keys illegally. 

683 :  It's because of people like you that real device owners and users can't use their devices as expected anymore. 

684 :  if you violate our code of conduct again, you will be permanently banned. 

685 :  Why is this issue still assigned to the `2.5 milestone` when `ansible 2.5` is already release a long time ago ? 

686 :  Running into this issue again and it sucks. 

687 :  Please guys, this issue has been open for almost 2 years now and for people who really use ansible-vault, this is a major pain the butt. 

688 :  We need a new free option, this is a core component and cannot be outsourced to 3rd party companies.  **THIS IS TOO CRITICAL** 

689 :  If you can't afford $1500 a year for IdentityServer4 to manage something as critical as identity for your business applications, drop them a line and let them know - pricing software products is a complicated business. 

690 :  OSS software isn't about other people doing things for you for free 

691 :  Funny how while it's been free, depending on 3rd parties has never been a problem... 

692 :  we'll make an announcement when ready"" 

693 :  Microsoft doesn't have to own everything dotnet. 

694 :  The sky isn't falling. 

695 :  If the answer is none" then _you're the problem_." 

696 :  I don't expect some - again VERY BASIC - functionality in my tech stack to change the licence 180°. 

697 :  It was their mistake to promote IS in the first place without making sure that it keeps the same license **forever** 

698 :  What an idi0t, not ok, just because he dont agree with someone else view. 

699 :   is out of line with personal comments like that. 

700 :  Clearly there's complexity in auth in general and within IS, and let's not pretend otherwise. 

701 :  Some of you were hopping over the line, some of you hopped over it, sprinted in the wrong direction and then threw things from 2.7 miles past the line. 

702 :  In any case, this is not the venue to discuss Duende's pricing, what open source means, and whether Microsoft should produce everything and kill off the .NET open source ecosystem in the process. 

703 :  We're done here and I'm locking the issue. 

704 :  Go linters complain when exported variables or constants are not documented (despite them being obvious in many cases), yet when core developers make major changes to go, they keep the old documentation, and don't even bother making it up-to-date. 

705 :  It was a neutral-tone, you might have never actually attached or imagined negative connotations to it if it weren't for me saying excuse me for my tone", which I have only said because I know how often people imagine hostility where there is none. :relaxed:" 

706 :  I cannot control how other people feel about me, and what emotions they attach to my statements. 

707 :  Despite what you say your words and actions do have a large impact on how people feel about what you write and how people interact with you. 

708 :  currently ` Dart` is more like: You want to do web? Sure, use AngularDart." (Hint: AngularDart != "the web")" 

709 :  LOL, no way. 

710 :  My commit is PUBLIC DOMAIN, do with it as you please. 

711 :  Perhaps also ask the lawyers what happens if someone later goes and fixes that typo. Thats basically stealing my public domain idea, regardless of your CLA, and then claiming it isnt because this wasnt known to you. 

712 :  Whacky position to be in :) 

713 :  Someone should start a GoFundMe campaign to pay for a lawyer who will challenge Google all the way to the Supreme Court, LOL 

714 :  I have OCD and I really want that typo fixed, now I know its there, it annoys me LOL. 

715 :  Can we please go back to focus on the issue at hand now, instead of having a meta discussion about how long people have had to test this. It is what it is right now, so let's look forward. 

716 :  I am amazed by how you, as the teacher, managed to avoiding pronouncing _any_ of the directives as en-gee" during the whole workshop." 

717 :  Did the girl really not notice the pattern of `ng-app`-`ng-init`-`ng-model`-`ng-if` leading to `ng-repeat`? 

718 :  Being curious about an official origin doesn't mean you're confused. 

719 :  a question on StackOverflow asking for the etymology of the `ng-` prefix is by no means evidence that it is a confusing name"." 

720 :  The project is already as inclusive as it gets: _everyone_ is welcome to use it and participate in its evolution by contributing, pointing out bugs, asking questions and helping others. Changing `ng-` to `ang-` would not affect this fact, positively or negatively. 

721 :  Furthermore, I am amazed by how you, as the teacher, managed to avoiding pronouncing _any_ of the directives as en-gee" during the whole workshop." 

722 :  I find it fascinating that someone at an Angular workshop was confused. 

723 :  Also, it would certainly not be easier to remember" because that would mean changing every existing material online." 

724 :  By this logic ang- is a terrible choice as it could stand for anything from negative words like ang-ry to religious words like ang-el. 

725 :  Trying to find two or three letters that are universally innocent in every language in a way that you cannot somehow turn them into something negative is probably an impossible task. 

726 :  Responding to that feeling by saying, basically, you are wrong" is practically providing proof that the angular community is not that welcoming." 

727 :  That sentence reads as a euphemism for that girl is stupid". Again: Not. Welcoming." 

728 :  Great, I'm glad you don't interpret `ng-repeat` negatively. 

729 :  It's so unbelievably annoying! 

730 :  This keeps coming up and it is SO ANNOYING. 

731 :  The people who's job it is to improve Visual Studio's user experience would be better equipped to fix this. 

732 :  Teams prioritizing things different from you is not negligence. 

733 :  The (ir)responsible team at Microsoft is neglecting a lot of users by not fixing this bug. 

734 :  It is a minor issue" in that it'd be easy for them to fix, although the choose not to.  It's not a "minor issue" in that it is indeed super annoying." 

735 :  And, as mentioned above, if that order doesn't fit your desires, you actually have something you can do about it. 

736 :  You seem to be seeking some sort of recognition and I must concede it to you. 

737 :  You have a knack for justifying inaction. 

738 :  I don't have time.  Nor really for this pointless discussion, although I hope you got something out of it at least. 

739 :  If you view my willingness to work with you to fix hte issues you care about as inaction" then that's on you." 

740 :  Thus it would be very unreasonable to expect app developers to do _even more_ work in the form of _unpaid_ casual side-jobs for various other projects such as Visual Studio etc, while simultaneously trying to perform their normal job 

741 :  It would be wildly unreasonable to expect app developers to sacrifice all of the following.  * Sacrifice mental health (re burn-out) as a consequence of excessive workload / unpaid side-jobs. * Sacrifice the proper raising of own children (applicable to everyone that has children), because of excessive time and energy spent doing unpaid side-jobs, resulting in insufficient time/energy remaining to properly raise and take care of children. * Sacrifice the relationship with partner/girlfriend/boyfriend/wife/husband. * Sacrifice a healthy amount of social life with friends and relatives (this loss can also lead to degradation of mental health). * Sacrifice relaxation/leisure time (insufficient leisure time also damages mental health). * Sacrifice fair working conditions and remuneration for staff members of businesses. * Sacrifice ethical behavior. 

742 :  However, it would be wildly unreasonable to expect to sacrifice himself like you do. 

743 :  My personal opinion is that your behavior appears to be unethical, inappropriate, and unprofessional, and it does not belong in any GitHub repository linked with Microsoft. 

744 :  Does that not strike you as ridiculous? 

745 :  You seem strangely passionate about defending their inaction. 

746 :  This is a delightful vignette about why we have rebindable key actions, and why we don't want to be prescriptive with user experience where terminal input" is concerned." 

747 :  your comment makes zero sense here. 

748 :  What C++ and/or Swift do isn't part of our decision making process for C#. 

749 :  'annoying' was not part of the decision making process. 

750 :  The language direction is not decided by polls. 

751 :  It should not be about believing or feeling ... It is not technical terms, there is should be Mind Map - what this feature will provide and allow to achieve ... 

752 :  It is entirely about that.  The language design group chooses which features are added to the language based on their personal beliefs and feelings. 

753 :  You underestimate our real usage 

754 :  Because he's continually said that this proposal had been rejected, he's said why it was rejected, and thus all this complaining on a rejected issue is just noise. 

755 :  If you want to talk about it further, do so where you have been asked to go. 

756 :  If you don't want to do that, you obviously don't care as much about your proposal as you seem to. 

757 :  This isn't your language. If it was, you'd be free to make all the changes you want, whatever the consequences, but it isn't. 

758 :  This isn't your language. 

759 :  Whether you did that or not is entirely up to you, but please stop moaning here, as you have been politely asked to do multiple times... 

760 :  I've seen you get upset and belligerent before when a proposal didn't go the way you wanted - it's getting old. 

761 :  But then the argument and debate must go into the gutter like chat channel to make it easier to forget, that's all reasoning I could understand about why we need to go there, the team just don't want to listen or even have clear evidence that people appeared to go against your decision (I might be overthinking things but this was one technique a dictator would used to suppress opinion of people) 

762 :  But for assumption that this feature will have `minimal usage` is very unlikely and very vague argument 

763 :  But not only there are no further explanation, you just demand people voice's to be drained into gitter and discord instead of the issue topic itself. 

764 :  This is what I really would called unreasonable 

765 :  But now you just don't want discussion to be under the issue and we don't have reason why it changed 

766 :  NOISE!! 

767 :  The difference is that those people gracefully did as was suggested as opposed to continually whine. 

768 :  You are acting like a petulant child, so I ask once again, if you're not willing to follow Cyrus' suggestion to move this discussion, PLEASE STOP! 

769 :  You seem to have some entitled opinion that just because you would find something useful, everybody else must, and thus it must be included in the language, and you're not willing to accept no" as an answer." 

770 :  END. FINIS. DONE. 

771 :  The decision making process is not done in a measured or mechanical fashion. 

772 :  This entire meta discussion on how people want the language designed is not useful here. 

773 :  (insert ominous music here) 

774 :  You guys aren't big fans of the KISS principle, I see. 

775 :  Microsoft once again doesn't fail to disappoint. 

776 :  my next action will be to get rid of this software immediately. 

777 :  I _dont_ appreciate you expressing it by heaping it on top of everybody I work with. 

778 :  Hi! Im a real person, happy to have a dialogue about that. 

779 :  This isn't the first time Microsoft is forcing good ideas" down my throat - if it was, I'd be happy to ask you about them directly, but this is just another data-point in a long history of similarly user-hostile actions." 

780 :  The irony of this statement is significant. You are literally clueing the user in to the opposite. I performed a customisation, and it is undone. This doesn't appear to be customisable"" 

781 :  You're right that our userbase is a technical audience, which is why we expected them to be able to <!--rub two brain cells together, and-->take the four seconds it takes to read the synthesized JSON, see the `hidden": false` that we stick in there, and think "hmm, maybe that hides the profile ”"." 

782 :  How about ASKING THE USER? Did that ever cross your mind? 

783 :  Hey, I've detected that you've made a change in the config. I'm about to undo all your work and confuse the hell out of you, Would you like me to continue?"" 

784 :  I even had people write to me to fix this today, that you guys are not seeing this is a huge issue like it is, shows where your priorities are. 

785 :  I know that also see people having this issues daily and even he has it, it's funny you guys dont think that is a huge problem.. 

786 :  As I stated, there is not enough time to duplicate all CI builds and to fix all the bugs that would get uncovered from there. 

787 :  The tool should serve the purpose, not the other way around! 

788 :  If you decide to solve it what's the point of saying in the middle okay now it's too difficult"." 

789 :  you should already know that things that *appear* trivial can, in fact, turn out to be intractable, and being combative about that helps no one. 

790 :  Did you a) (only) respond to the issue, or did you b) choose to unnecessarily attack my experience? 

791 :  So feels like it is the other way around to me. ‚ 

792 :  your attitude here makes my day measurably worse. 

793 :  I've asked you to do this once already and am not going to ask a third time - if you continue to be combative to people just trying to help, we'll be asking you to discontinue your engagement on the issue tracker. 

794 :  Your comment is insulting and more than useless 

795 :  bitch needs a slap 

796 :  Keep in mind that violations of the code of conduct can result in being banned. 

797 :  I always try to remind participants that we are *all* striving to make TypeScript better - but if you want to participate, the only way to do so is with respect. 

798 :  We can't tolerate abrasive language or tone on this issue tracker, and it has clearly become a problem here, so I'm closing the thread. 

799 :  If you cannot do that, we cannot allow you to engage on the issue tracker. 

800 :  I'm fed up the whole framework is filled with this crap. 

801 :  Why you even do double way binding if works half the needed cases? 

802 :  Don't even make a framework at this point 

803 :  It has no fucking sense. 

804 :  If the customer didn't specifically asked for angular I would have thrown this piece of trash in the toilet long time ago 

805 :  Thumbs down my ass, it's reality  that smacks your face 

806 :  Spoiler: no template i have no time to waste 

807 :  Instead of thumbing down like twitter and facebook kids, show me I'm wrong ¥‡ 

808 :  thumbs down don't bother me, take some relief on your real life frustration and let them rain down ’¯ 

809 :  Thats the damn problem 

810 :  Hundreds of issues at day you say. A stable and mature and professional product after all these years shouldnt. 

811 :  Instead it leaves you clueless with these kind of things and stupid documentation which is a copy paste from semi working code samples from tour of heroes which in some case alre also wrong and with errors in it. 

812 :  Yeah don't cry in silence and show us your strong arguments against my point 

813 :  This long reply is to show that I'm not just an angry fool, lot of people is fed up with it and it actually is an half baked crippled tool 

814 :  But there is an even more FUNNY thing. I AM ACTUALLY ALREADY USING setValue even before writing this post!!! 

815 :  At some point you have to trust engine contributors to know what bugs are. 

816 :  Here, renamed, be happy. 

817 :  This is getting silly already. No way it makes any sense. 

818 :  How is this offtopic? Please stop bringing politics into development world. That's just mindblowingly silly. 

819 :  That is hilarious. 

820 :  What is the next requirement OpenJS will ask for? To remove the **test** directory to avoid similarity with **test**icles? 

821 :  I'm not understanding why tasks could be included dynamically, but a playbook wouldn't be. 

822 :  I need to conditionally import a playbook, which isn't possible.  The keyword I'm missing is include_playbook" which would allow a "when" to apply to it." 

823 :  Of course we do. 

824 :  Oh, so you monitor them, but completely ignore them. Much better. 

825 :  You are making toxic and unhelpful statements. 

826 :  If you want to continue to make mean and unhelpful assumptions and remarks, go ahead, but then we can just close down this whole thread as well. 

827 :  Sarcasm and profanity will not help you get your issues resolved. 

828 :  I find it extremely frustrating using terminal as a REPL. 

829 :  I think it's quite stubborn to say you know what your users want. 

830 :  TBH, you really can't force down the throat of what tastes bland. 

831 :  If you don't like the new window, that's fine. 

832 :  If you don't want to give feedback on the new idea, because you just want us to fix the original REPL, that's fine too. 

833 :  Actually, please don't fix it. I am not paying you. And you believe you have the best idea, and that my request is too much. 

834 :  No, I don't think spending some personal time investigating a problem you have with a software you got from me for free is rude"." 

835 :  I've pointed out your mistake and you are perfectly capable of spotting the difference between the original configuration that was working and you've commented out and the one you've changed and that don't. 

836 :  Too bad that you do not consider this rude 

837 :  you do not care. 

838 :  it just not helpful to make false statements like: 'works for me' and 'you messed up writers' because you did not bother to run the repro-case following very simple instructions. 

839 :  If I state that your sample works for me", it of course means that I did bother running it on my side and didn't get to reproduce the issue you're mentioning." 

840 :  Perhaps the Linux project should change its name as they've conflicted with a city in Hawaii which existed long before. 

841 :  I feel like there's much less confusion between a city in Hawaii and a multi platform app framework both called Maui than a multi platform app framework and a multi platform app framework both called Maui. 

842 :  So you think of a Hawaian city when reading Maui", but not when reading "MAUI"? Really?" 

843 :  You find the comparison between a city in Hawaii and MauiKit ridiculous just like I find your comparison between an the Maui abbreviation and MauiKit ridiculous 

844 :  So yeah, there's an obvious naming clash here 

845 :  How is having two product with the same name and same basic scope (multi platform framework) a non issue? 

846 :  this project you're fighting for so passionately, doesn't have as many stars as I have thumbs down for telling you that you'e being ridiculous 

847 :  That's because GitHub stars are not a currency in which you measure a project that is not even developed on GitHub. 

848 :  I don't think they took into account either confusion with the Linux project" *nor with the Hawaiian island*." 

849 :  By the way, is it seriously necessary to mention that when there's an obvious name conflict with some other free software project in the exactly same domain (UI toolkit)? 

850 :  get over this Linux vs. Windows" mantra you still seem to follow." 

851 :  yes, this was half sarcasm, half serious comment. I think you can figure out which half's which. 

852 :  And this is not even a confusing _similarity_. We are talking about a multi platform framework called MAUI, and a multi platform framework called MAUI. 

853 :  You could've at least googled the name you were giving to your product before doing so, or choose one that's used from a product with a different scope. 

854 :  so you like this cute little side project... but let's be honest here when it comes to being a serious project it's not one. 

855 :  Your attitude is as if Microsoft is being some big evil corporation. 

856 :  Ok let's look at kde... there are 10 open issues... are you seriously going to tell me that a serious cross platform framework has 10 open issues... that's not realistic in any shape way or form. So again your complaints are just being ridiculous. 

857 :  The reality is I highly doubt anybody heard of MauiKit, and frankly nobody cares. 

858 :  Are you an _official_ Microsoft or Xamarin representative, and if so, is this the official position of your company?. 

859 :  What do you expect, providing some real arguments against nonsense or offending replies like you're all mad" or "it's the others' fault, they need to rename" (aka "we are Microsoft (related), we are bigger, you need to comply" or, my favorite, "same name is not a problem at all", pretending that confusion was not an issue..." 

860 :  great strategy, being offending once you run out of arguments! 

861 :  How can you seriously accuse others of like, thinking in this old it's a big evil company" way (which nobody really has), while yourself being extremely off-putting towards the open-source community? It makes no sense..." 

862 :  How can you seriously accuse others of like, thinking in this old it's a big evil company" way (which nobody really has), while yourself being extremely off-putting towards the open-source community? It makes no sense..." 

863 :  You have *zero* reason to belittle this or _any_ other open-source project. 

864 :  Imagine trying to put up a faÃ§ade with mslinux, then turning stuff into a dick size competition with repo stars and other stats because you know you messed up and don't want to admit it lmfao 

865 :  you want to see what a real Open Source application framework looks like I suggest you start taking notes. 

866 :  It is unethical, you are don't have any arguments? 

867 :  I don't know how you can question the seriousness of one of the biggest communities that drive open source principles many years before Microsoft fell in love with open source. 

868 :  So a project has value based on open issues? 

869 :  There appear to be more passive-aggressive comments towards another project in this thread from you alone than there are from all other people towards this .NET repository. 

870 :  Unless you _actually_ work for the companies involved, your opinion is probably negligible here. 

871 :  I'm surprised no one complained about Microsoft's use of the name `core` 

872 :  What I do see is a bunch of people who want to complain but probably never have used Xamarin and probably never will use Maui regardless of what it's called. 

873 :  Beautiful! You steal name and say that it's OK! Good position! 

874 :  ... not sure if you expect us all to email you now, but please be prepared... 

875 :  Isn't that the exact opposite thing that any sane person would do? 

876 :  Its OK to be passionate but attacking another open source project for any reason is not okay. 

877 :  This is not the kind of community we want to have and such behavior will not be tolerated. 

878 :  Using sexual abusive language is not the way to express your opinion. 

879 :  Your assumption about that it's self-descriptiveness is only _partially_ correct when you refer to several ppl you mentioned. 

880 :  I myself try avoiding to assume that other people see and understand things exactly the same way as me, because every individual has their own unique experience. That said I encourage you to not make such assumptions here. 

881 :  You give false impression to others. 

882 :  Brian should argue his case from a position of hands on, mature knowledge rather than having us collect that for him and demanding his proposal be accepted unmodified and that none of us is in a better position than to test and evaluate the suitability of including the proposal of porting `canonicalize` unmodified into the go standard library for Windows than he himself and the company he works for. 

883 :  It's fairly frustrating to see my words being repeatedly 

884 :  You're incorrect 

885 :  I don't appreciate trying to have the last word on this argument after I told you I don't wish to debate it. 

886 :  Not only is your comment extremely insulting to the work my team is doing, you keep going and rambling we caAaAn't truUust theEem theEey're the deviIil in disguiIise"." 

887 :  I find this behavior ridiculous, entitled, and generally not up to the standard our community should strive for. 

888 :  Everyone who disagrees with me doesn't know what they are talking about"" 

889 :  Nice, the only notable contribution you've ever made anywhere on Github is making sure everyone at Google knows you're a racist. 

890 :  BlackLivesMatter is not meant to be a racist statement, except you see it like this. 

891 :  So you need fix it in you county, and do not force your problems to all world! 

892 :  Anyway this issue will be closed without an answer since Google doesn't care about people but sticking to their narrative. 

893 :  Everyone here will be called a white supremacist antiblack antiasian antilgtbteq1324 and risking to be banned from the repo. 

894 :  Welcome to 1984. 

895 :  Nothing more cringey than tech framework sites posting about politics, even if you agree with the sentiment. 

896 :  You know what, the white A" in the Angular logo is all of a sudden making me feel uncomfortable...maybe even a little oppressed. Hmm, could the Angular team be racists??? Maybe we should make a separate issue to change the color to black." 

897 :  Just noticed the #BlackLivesMatter banner on the home page for the first time...what a joke. 

898 :  Anyone have a list of other political movements endorsed by the Angular site? 

899 :  What's racist about it? Also don't shame others based on their skills and development experience. That's against the code of conduct. 

900 :  All lives matter" isn't racist either, yet apparently saying that makes you a white supremacist or something." 

901 :  People can express their opinions but the mods are just gonna lock it away cause y'all can't behave" and "the discussion is getting out of hand and is not productive anymore"" 

902 :  Funny how the first comment is being sarcastic about [the master branch] 

903 :  I guess I'll give up my Master's degree to show solidarity. 

904 :  why is it on the front-page of Angular and **what is the criteria** which determines what gets on the front page. **Who decides what's important enough?** 

905 :  If you're so sure that it's such a good idea, why do you have to act so quick about locking it so as not to give people a chance to give their opinion on the matter? 

906 :  But it just feels less and less a framework and more and more a political board. 

907 :  Why are you using this platform for displaying your political agenda. You have other platforms to do that. No one wants this here. 

908 :  This crap has gotten way out of control, give em an inch and they'll try to take a mile. 

909 :  Enough is enough already, rather than people getting offended by a word that is not offensive in this context, 

910 :  I can't believe the insanity that's going on. 

911 :  That's the context and the only context. 

912 :  I guess my `Masters Degree` now has to renamed to `Main Degree` as well.. 

913 :  Simply stupid. 

914 :  Stupid, like all this progressive shit destroying everything it touches. 

915 :  Simply stupid. There's no other way to put it. Stupid, like all this progressive shit destroying everything it touches. 

916 :  I recommend you finding another tool where you can work with easily without headache yourself with this particular one. This is what I did myself. 

917 :  You have missed some quotes around a string. 

918 :  I am a scikit-learn newbie and have just have spent a frustrating time going thought the docs, and I can't find anywhere how to read my own data (and not a prepared toy dataset), and what the python format of data is. 

919 :  I don't know whether you are one of scikit-learn staff or not, but I need to say that your way of talking is harming both scikit-learn staff and users (us) 

920 :  you seem quite misinformed about what is scikit-learn, how it works, and how the project is developed. 

921 :  it's literally your job. or you are here just to spam random stuff till people get pissed off and leave? 

922 :  your comments look absolutely random with quite zero connection to the reality. either a bot or ... very unintelligent person. which is fine by me as long as you keep a distance from me. 

923 :  so, if you don't know a solution, DO NOT POST ANY COMMENTS. 

924 :  and again  if you don't know a solution, DO NOT POST ANY COMMENTS. 

925 :  bot or something? your comments look absolutely random with quite zero connection to the reality. either a bot or ... very unintelligent person. which is fine by me as long as you keep a distance from me. 

926 :  There is no need for personal insults or caps. 

927 :  i dint yet started the insults. its called personal observation. look it up. 

928 :  what consoles and what modes? (did you actually read the ''To Reproduce'' ????? i have the feeling you didnt) 

929 :  now i have the feeling you didn't read anything at all. 

930 :  or you just assume that if it works for you work for absolutely everyone? 

931 :  you have not actually commented here regarding the problem or the intention to fix it. 

932 :  A bit of research can help you get the info you need in order to be able to perform the necessary tests to confirm/deny your theory so you can start acting on knowledge. 

933 :  Seeing this issue as well, its very annoying. 

934 :  Now: it seems like the discussion here _has_ reached its terminus, so there isnt value in leaving it unlocked for angry people to get their digs in. 

935 :  while I fully understand your reasoning, this is detrimental to people learning how to use Ansible. 

936 :  AT LEAST remove the banner for people that are not in the US. 

937 :  No, it got locked because people disagree with your ignorant stance. 

938 :  I will not participate in a dictatorship as you're too dumb on the matter to be my leader. 

939 :  You guys suck at everything! 

940 :  WTF Microsoft! 

941 :  Microsoft should grow turnips instead of writing software! 

942 :  I would be tempted to blame legalization for this kind of mishap, but you guys have always sucked at software! 

943 :  Windows sucks and now you even made .NET, your crown jewels, suck! 

944 :  This wasted several hours of my time trying to work through the suggested troubleshooting tips 

945 :  Can't you guys get anything done without turning it into a nightmare? 

946 :  Everything you guys put your hands on sucks! 

947 :  Relax and take your medication. 

948 :  So I guess I need to be smoking the same grass you're smoking in order to medicate my way out of seeing Microsoft's mediocrity?  No thanks! 

949 :  Because we can undo it" is not a good reason to present bad statistics." 

950 :  So as long as everyone reads through at least the first 39 pages of the Unicode standard then there shouldn't be any problem. 

951 :  Meanwhile, you've provided zero evidence to support your claim, which is based solely on your personal experience. 

952 :  It's no wonder that even Google's own engineers could care less about the company's style guides. 

953 :  And here I'd thought that Google workers were above mansplaining.  Stupid me 

954 :  It's a very convenient way of saying that the bug I had in my code was a bug with my design rather than the .Net Native compiler even though my code did/should work in any given .Net runtime context, but .Net Native is special, thus requiring special design considerations. 

955 :  before you close this issue you will have to adjust where you point the finger. 

956 :  The problem isn't with MessagePack, according to @MichalStrehovsky the problem is your design choice since you, being on the inside of Microsoft, have an even better understanding of the way the .Net Native compiler works. 

957 :  It may be a PITA to have .Net Native issues surfaced this way. 

958 :  Both the comment you make and the way initiated the closure of this issue was disingenuous. 

959 :  Just say so and stop pretending that any of the .Net Native compiler problems will actually be addressed. 

960 :  A year went by on the gRPC issue.  A year with no resolution!  I'd even be ok with a form of admission and a statement along the lines that we need to resolve these issues ourselves.   At least that way, time wouldn't be wasted on false expectations. 

961 :  ou're wasting a lot of our time slandering our competence 

962 :  You can censor me if you like. 

963 :  you keep bringing it back to advocating for breaking compatibility in the language design as if this was the same level of implication. 

964 :  I'm tired of this bikeshedding. I tried to advocate for keeping this issue focused on the actual bug that can be fixed (syntax highlighting) 

965 :  Seems more like Bram enjoys taking all the credit. 

966 :  It literally takes less than 30 minutes to learn git. That's no excuse. 

967 :  No, I don't understand.  Any software developer doing things exactly the same as 10 years ago is a **bad** software developer, let alone 30 years ago. 

968 :  To think that a new idea is better than an old one simply because it is new is foolish. 

969 :  When looking for information about Vim, the place to look is always the built-in help. Not Google, not the manpages, not the github metadata, just the help. In this case: :help credits 

970 :  So, instead of ranting here, maybe you should try to find the cause of the problem and/or open a PR that fixes this kind of issue, if necessary. 

971 :  This seems unnecessarily hostile, especially given that, in your own words, - I shouldn't complain about software I had nothing to pay for"" 

972 :  Have you considered simply reporting the issue, without any of the assholery? 

973 :  If you would like to re-open another GitHub issue calmly describing your problem with less vitriol and toxicity, I will gladly add it to my next release milestone, I'll add a test case for the situation, and I'll forget that this exchange happened. 

974 :  Sorry to say, that I am totally pissed off from this worst programmed piece of software/plugin I have ever seen. 

975 :  You actually need to keep hearing our feedback, every one of us. 

976 :  you should be working to find the screams because it takes tons of effort for us to get the screams close to you. 

977 :  you should want to know about all of these peoples feedback, especially when its them screaming in paper cut agony. 

978 :  So, let's put it straight, with the largest, boldest letters: **THIS IS NOT A FLUTTER ISSUE, There is no Flutter solution or workaround and never will be.** 

979 :  don't be stupid, it's a bug 

980 :  Your belief that you're doing anyone a favor by varying from the expected command line tool behavior, you should turn in your commit per.issions and get a job in management where you don't have access to break things AGAIN. 

981 :  By not doing what the command line tools do, you are varying from the expected behavior and breaking convention. THIS IS WRONG. 

982 :  Save your energy. Lex has rejected this again and again. 

983 :  Put your overlays as extra quads into your item model, he says. 

984 :  Threatening to coremods shit because you haven't spent 10 mins looking into other solutions is not the way to get things added to forge. 

985 :  It's pretty useless to complain about someone not looking without pointing them in the right direction. 

986 :  It's excruciatingly abrasive and dickish and impedes fostering a community that actually wants to contribute to a project. 

987 :  Going off on someone because you assume they haven't searched for other solutions makes you look like a dick. 

988 :  I don't care if you consider my response dickish, your initial post was. 

989 :  i'm sick of being threatened by people and coremods. 

990 :  I would have loved to work with you, but since you were not willing to accept any recommendations, I am closing this and we will do any remaining work in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/48058. 

991 :  WTF guys, you can't make built version of app? 

992 :  so to use it i need to download huge amounts of not needed data and applications? That not how the Linux works. 

993 :  And also polite mean to make installation for users, and not throwing in their faces some code and say do whatever you want with it"." 

994 :  t's really not that hard to understand... 

995 :  Why don't you develop your own terminal instead of asking like you are the CEO of Microsoft? 

996 :  Some people shouldn't act like a ass just because they think different. 

997 :  I agree that @creotiv should not act like an ass 

998 :  I didn't mean that but whatever floats your boat man. ƒ 

999 :  Where's your binaries?  Just because it's early and incomplete" (just like this code on this repo is) shouldn't be an excuse." 

1000 :  3 month to make an installer for an app)) that's nice) 

1001 :  Look, 24h later, a valid tiny patch is still not merged and we'd need to discuss" why shippable failed on its improvement, not even on the patch itself." 

1002 :  I can submit the bug elsewhere but do you really mean to suggest that I need to know about HPLIP and cups-filters to understand why three different tools process the options I've set (using your software) in three different ways? 

1003 :  Who takes responsibility when other projects don't know how to interface correctly with your software? 

1004 :  Are you ever grateful to receive bug reports about your project? 

1005 :  You don't think any of your documentation needs to be fixed? 

1006 :  So cups-pdf is HP's problem too? Is there any Linux software you can name that interfaces with CUPS correctly? 

1007 :  Is there any Linux software you can name that interfaces with CUPS correctly? 

1008 :  It would help to have an answer to this question, relating to the configuration of face-up printers 

1009 :  Please look at this, because @raver119 is still angry I said C wasn't a good language. 

1010 :  I don't even remember who you are. 

1011 :  That's a bit of surprising statement. 

1012 :  P.s. sorry. Just too many people around. 

1013 :  Keep it professional or I won't hesitate to ban you from interacting with this repository. 

1014 :  Just seems pointless to continue supporting something that uses so much developer time. 

1015 :  You can do that, but don't blame the software then. 

1016 :  You still try to push Salt to adhere to OMV data format, while common sense says it should be otherwise. 

1017 :  i alreeady said it was kneejerk impulse, so you eems to be crashing through door wide open. 

1018 :  You blaze of ego is called for. 

1019 :  Yesterday i spent hours looking into Salt code and patching it along your suggestions. 

1020 :  First i took your suggestions as correct and thought through. And just followed them. An then had to undo it all. 

1021 :  Now you imply it was your time wasted not mine. 

1022 :  you refused to help me doing it. 

1023 :  You made me look into Linux kernel i am not familiar with, at the same time you are not very willing to point me to specific OMV code and Salt commands you are familiar with. 

1024 :  you are funny :) 

1025 :  you can learn a bit about semantics, grammar and the meanings of words - essentialy about language and usage :)  can you tell me who was here offended ? 

1026 :  when we have storage OOM gradle doesn't sygnalize that, instead proper info we have a bullshit :) 

1027 :  still some daemon shit WTF ??? 

1028 :  Flutter team, PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE PROPERLY! 

1029 :  It looks like no one from Flutter team cares about the issue. 

1030 :  I'm sorry but I have to be this guy... The fact is that you left this repository unanswered for two plain month. 

1031 :  you MUST understant that without repo's activity people will not be interested in SUI anymore, and you'll try to find funds for a dead project... 

1032 :  I am BEGGING @levithomason, @jlukic, or any other project owner to PLEASE add at least two more trusted owners or managers with the power to add more committers and maintainers so badly needed. 

1033 :  A 10 second look would of shown you that. 

1034 :  do not readd links in which I have removed, do it again and you'll be blocked. 

1035 :  I have instructed you on two paths on how to achieve your goal now. 

1036 :  I don't appreciate you basically calling me an idiot in all caps when you didn't bother to even consider that maybe I had a good reason for doing it the way I did. 

1037 :  Except, you don't have a good reason, if you would of worked with anyone in the community to figure things out before resorting to hacking things with a coremod then we would be having a different conversation. 

1038 :  Fuck you flutter, if macos adds PATH, it just wont join, go to hell, youre so ugly, Google is so big, will the script be configured to die? 

1039 :  This is why Linux products are the way they are, and why no one had ever heard of KDE MAUI until now -- you lot just argue about inane stuff instead of getting work done. 

1040 :  Are you a lawyer? Maybe you should check with one before you potentially commit business libel. 

1041 :  Yes, I am opening a new one because fuck you Microsoft. 

1042 :  You are merely trying to cast a shadow on other, truly open source projects. 

1043 :  why did you close this? 

1044 :  The maintainers of the project are using a dependency that is buggy, they should take care of this 

1045 :  That's your responsibility to take care of things that don't work as expected in the dependencies of your project. 

1046 :  You are advertising syntax highlighting, you are supposed to deliver! 

1047 :  And if you don't, you are supposed to take care of whatever is needed to have your product work as expected 

1048 :  We're not contractually obligated to work on every bug and answer every question, seeing as we simply don't have enough resources. 

1049 :  (I) really love this ability to minimize comments on GitHub.. :sparkles: 

1050 :  You got us. It's a joke. 

1051 :  I mean cmon guys, is this a joke? 

1052 :  It is ridiculously funny not having a password lock for the most sensible information inside the phone that leads to basically unlocking all of your secure accounts. 

1053 :  I mean cmon guys, is this a joke? 2FA without a feature to lock the screen from people? 

1054 :  Your tone is derogatory. 

1055 :  This is the incorrect approach based upon your issue. 

1056 :  You got my support on this @filmgirl. 

1057 :  rooting for you @filmgirl ‰ 

1058 :  11/10, want to see this happen! ’œ 

1059 :  Knowing that this is possible my life will not be the same without it 

1060 :  I can't believe it hasn't already been implemented, this is a must have feature. 

1061 :  This needs a kickstarter campaign 

1062 :  How have I been using Terminal without this feature for so long? I'm using plain old terminal until we have it! 

1063 :  This explains a lot and why microsoft made ton of bad decisions recently, maybe the people at the top are delusional? 

1064 :  This is really offending for people that are suffering for global warming and desertfication areas. 

1065 :  Also is that a natural snow icon or a fake snow icon? 

1066 :  Please think about how much water Is wasted to create artificial snow just for games 

1067 :  It is really offending me because I am very snow sensitive and get hurt by snowflakes when it is snowing. 

1068 :  If I see that on the VS code I feel physically hurt. 

1069 :  On the other hand snowflake is the best symbol for spineless corporations bowing down to any random activist complain. 

1070 :  Also there was some recent effort to associate snowflake and Santa with its red hat to drug consumption so please don't talk about Its red hat and snow symbol in the same thread. :smile_cat: 

1071 :  I am with you guys- the one **TROLL** that offended many, many people got his wish fulfilled. Only ONE person wanted this ridiculous change and you are just ignoring so many requests to bring back what was deleted. Shame on you, shame. 

1072 :  You're not my dad, I can use everything I like / dislike! 

1073 :  Please stop offended me! You're not my dad, I can use everything I like / dislike! 

1074 :  I'd be really  grateful if that the correct reaction will be delivered like the other one, snowflakes do hurt and sting in the eyes, I won't be able to sleep if I see all day this hurtful symbol of pain and climate oppression in my IDE. 

1075 :  Some guy in Microsoft HQ is sweating right now.  Although this is 100% deserved. 

1076 :  His name is **Christian**, that must be a troll account, too good to be true :D 

1077 :  I'm from New Zealand, and in the Southern Hemisphere, it's not cold, but hot during the holiday season. I suggest you geo-locate the user's position and prompt them for the icon of their choice, e.g. snow, ice, fire, sun shine. 

1078 :  Every Christian should be renamed immediately to eliminate possible offence. 

1079 :  This is a serious discussion about the terror that is snow flakes and how it terrorises a lot of people everyday, even more now with the new VS Code update. 

1080 :  I would also like to point out that snow(flake) is _white_ and is commonly used as a white supremacy symbol to oppress and marginalize whole ethnicities, which due to systemic geographic discrimination couldn't historically experience, first-hand, full range of weather phenomena. 

1081 :  Winter is one good buff against invaders in Russia. Praise the winter! Let it snow! 

1082 :  The Snow Flake on vscode insiders and pushing it as a cozy"/"wintery" thing is very offensive to me." 

1083 :  This isn't just me either, think about the people who cannot even get snow, think about how you're making them feel, making them see what they cannot get, although personally I don't understand that. Snow is terrifying. 

1084 :  Oh no, I just mentioned way too many forbidden things, so this is getting removed too. Along with this thread. And me. And you. 

1085 :  We must remove the hat, all mentions of the hat, all mentions of removing the mentions of the hat and so on, just to be sure. 

1086 :  That's way too rational, a guy was extremely offended, please have some consideration! 

1087 :  The removing of the Santa hat and catering to vocal minority of sjw idiots is very offensive to me. 

1088 :  If Santa is a religious figure, then so is the Grinch, 

1089 :  It's so sad that people are so sensitive in the world we live in today that this sort of thing is even worth discussion.. 

1090 :  My understanding is that he was actually upset of the pagan origins :man_shrugging: 

1091 :  It was removed all because of this one guy: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/87268 and he prob think that what he did is funny. 

1092 :  Got as far as to feel the joy of my parents being alive, but then a snowflake got in the way and I got offended. 

1093 :  In addition, it reminds me of black people lurking around. 

1094 :  Microsoft scares me by forcing people to use this theme. 

1095 :  Please don't laugh. This is a serious issue for me. I want to force removal of the feature for everyone, because it hurts my feelings. And no, don't make a toggle for it. It would remind me that a death is still there, but not visible. 

1096 :  I don't know if it makes any difference, but I'm a black Jew living in Uganda. 

1097 :  To avoid being offended, please use the transparent perspicuous pellucid theme. 

1098 :  Did you just say trans-parent? But it's ok, my conservative belifs can and even should be offended. 

1099 :  PC?! What if I'm a mac-user?! 

1100 :  Dark theme is basically a blackface of white editors. 

1101 :  VS Code dark theme reminds me of this situation, so please remove it immediately, because for me dark theme = death. 

1102 :  User Christian-Schiffer that created such awful request offended many users and Microsoft just standing there like nothing happened. 

1103 :  I demand syntax highlighting be removed, as it reminds me of the other night when I puked out the three plates of ravioli I'd eaten. It is very offensive to me and instantly brings back memories of a very bad stomachache. 

1104 :  I find the V" in "VS Code" offensive. It represents two fingers being held up in an obscene gesture and could be read as "F*ck You"." 

1105 :  This censorship is literally a new holocaust! 

1106 :  I'm extremely offended by the fact that because of religious beliefs @Mikotochan 's only life pleasure has been taken away. 

1107 :  You deserve an award for skyrocketting the level of drama of this topic  – ! 

1108 :  One time a random person told me to œgit good and since then, œgit is extremely offensive to me. 

1109 :  Please remove Python compatibility I'm scared of snakes. 

1110 :  It's funny and sad at the same time that one selfish issue can cause loss of hundrets of man-days (people-days?) across globe. 

1111 :  I enjoy reading drama, please don't take my only pleasure in life away. 

1112 :  I think it is necessary to **remove** this Terminal" word, as it can really offend someone's feelings in some country at some time." 

1113 :  Additionally Terminal" has cost millions of Jews their lives over the centuries because the word "terminal" could also mean ["Extermination Camp"]" 

1114 :  Terminal" might also remind someone about a terminal illness they are facing" 

1115 :  Oh my god! Man! It's something that I wish for the years! Christmas miracle literally exists! 

1116 :  people who thumb down the santa have never received a present from him, naughty boys 

1117 :  it seems like kernel trauma, it has befriended santa and now microsoft crushed its dreams 

1118 :  Please add also an ultra-offensive debugger that shitstorms you on every error 

1119 :  I also can't focus on my work since then, please let me be productive again 

1120 :  Please make it your top priority to bring Santa hat back. 

1121 :  Coding productivity has decreased enormously since the removal of the Santa hat. 

1122 :  Assuming he wasn't just trolling: if one gets butthurt and triggered over an emoji or icon, then the internet is not really the place where one should hang around. 

1123 :  Pandering to icon haters seems to be high on Microsoft's list instead of handling actual bug fixes or feature requests. 

1124 :  Are you happy @Christian-Schiffer? Your behaviour offence a lot of people around the world. 

1125 :  I think you must apologize to these people and @egamma must do it too. 

1126 :  Get back the Santa icon you morons 

1127 :  How much of a brain do you have to delete that icon as a result of hate speech of a single idiot? 

1128 :  XDDDDD careful. microsoft now owns github too and they also take direct orders from jerusalem. your account will be vanished in no time. their petty feelings are way above yours so hush now 

1129 :  This Santa Hat situation is unacceptable. This is outrageous and humiliating. 

1130 :  We demand apologies from @microsoft and that the Hat be back! 

1131 :  Im just sickk of having to go through thousnads of tutorials, forums, chats, emails and so on every time Unity updates, or the HoloToolkit or the MRDL or visual studio... It is just SUPER UNSTABLE and a serious pain in the *** to do anything. 

1132 :  This is the first time I've heard from you, so **let's open a new issue and try to figure out what's going on**. 

1133 :  I am dead serious, WHEN??? You are not adding/doing anything useful to it, nothing beneficial for the end user. 

1134 :  This conversation is over. 

1135 :  why the hell did you haphazardly change the initial value of properties in this commit??? 

1136 :  why the hell you break my code programmed against gradle 4.10 in the **very first** release after that??? 

1137 :  i can't believe you guys, this is completely irresponsible. and don't tell me you needed to do this to support property conventions, you didn't. 

1138 :  again, I insist my way to fix this problem, which is no doubt the most simple and efficient approach to this problem. 

1139 :  I don't care about which PR will be merged finally, but I do care about the most reasonable solution for this problem. 

1140 :  This isn't how we have technical disagreements. No amount of technical correctness can make up for treating other people poorly, please don't repeat that behavior. 

1141 :  I don't know why you're so hysterical about which PR should be merged, and what I want to clarify here is that obviously I found this problem before you, and I have not even found the existence of golang/net@08b3837 until @fisherxu mentioned it in my PR, that why I push a new commit using http2.ConfigureTransports today and open this [PR](https://github.com/golang/net/pull/84) trying to fix the problem before. 

1142 :  And besides I didn't have any reference on your PR as I have not even noticed you before. 

1143 :  you should learn how to use Git with clear&clean commit history. 

1144 :  You have disagreement but no reason. That's personal. 

1145 :  You are so unbelievably arrogant that I don't want to waste my time arguing with you. 

1146 :  No amount of technical correctness can make up for treating other people poorly 

1147 :  that's not a good excuse for doing nothing, not everybody like you github employees (I heard most atom developers are ?) has a macbook for each, and there are many ones still using old computers, ... 

1148 :  You still haven't addressed my concern with this Issue, @crquan, namely that there isn't a method of determining if Atom is beyond the size of an editor should be"." 

1149 :  Is 207MB too big? Is 200MB? Is 10MB? Please give an example of what size is small enough" and what size "too big" and, most importantly, why." 

1150 :  A bug is nearly worthless if it cannot ever be fixed. And without a clearly defined goal, this bug cannot be fixed. 

1151 :  want to speak directly, the words very cheap to buy a USB" seems really ridiculous." 

1152 :  That make no sense, why you make efforts to a open source, because you love it. when you love it, why not keep it the best.

Original test dataset:

TEXT
1 :  Can you give indications on where the changes should happen and other indications? 

2 :  I am a bit lost in the source code 

3 :  My sincere apologies if I missed something. 

4 :  If I sound hostile, it because I am kindly sharing the user hostility you're unleashing on developers trying to get work done. 

5 :  I don't know anything about gclient or gyp, and I didn't see any documentation in the repo to lead me in the right direction (except the README, which tells me I should be looking in tools/). 

6 :  I'm afraid that without guidance/help I won't be able to move far with the port. 

7 :  I'm also having huge issues with building NSPR similarly to what was reported in comment #&#173,7 over an year ago. 

8 :  I would like to help .. just don't think I have the needed skills. 

9 :  Unfortunately since then work has been busy which left no time for further dart work. 

10 :  It's quite sad that not all of the interested parties were invited to the table. 

11 :  I understand your frustration at the delay in getting this in. 

12 :  It is possible that moving the files to third_party is not ideal but it does provide us a clean separation of the hosts that the Dart team ships periodically as install ready binaries in a SDK vs other hosts. 

13 :  If you have other ideas on how we can maintain this separation I am willing to listen. 

14 :  I had plans to make a proper port (with separate files and not patches on the linux ones) but after seeing how the Dart team treated the BSD ports efforts and specially Mulander's work ... I really got disappointed and lost all interest in Dart! 

15 :  I've likewise abandoned Dart because I see nothing in the Dart project to give me confidence that it will be ported. 

16 :  I'm willing to give it another look if things change, but I can't use something if it doesn't support the systems I deploy on. 

17 :  This would really help modularizing our code 

18 :  The lack of communication on one of, if not the most requested feature of the last 3-4 years is not something to appreciate. 

19 :  They decided to implement it which is great news, crass comments like these do not help anyone. 

20 :  apologise if you felt somehow attacked by my comment. 

21 :  Lose more games than the Jets and act like you are a team full of Tom Bradys. 

22 :  It would be great if aside from the current way of building widgets you could add JSX like capabilities. 

23 :  Sorry if I sound defensive or aggressive. :-) 

24 :  don't take my argumentative tone as dismissive, I'm very interested in your input here. 

25 :  Stop nit-picking things that are not fully specified. 

26 :  Make Flutter look familiar to React developers and you have a chance of attracting a bunch of new users to Flutter. 

27 :  Wow, could have written a blog post xD 

28 :  The point being, we haven't made any decisions yet, and are very open to learning what needs to be done based on all these discussions and experiments. 

29 :  That I appreciate and I read all your 'long writings', answering everything: no way, but when I answer properly you don't understand my answer and concludes that I am being dismissive. 

30 :  And if, by chance, he was being sincere, then I apologize for my snideness 

31 :  We are very interested to better understand your scenarios where WCF server side functionality is required. 

32 :  I have dreamed for years of having WCF across their entire network so that I can finally (!) have reliable transactions and durable services spanning their various generations of Linux and Windows. 

33 :  Having WCF on .Net core is not only desirable, it is essential. 

34 :  We have a strong need to run .NET/WCF on Linux, so please add this to the road map! 

35 :  Stop invest in dead technologies such as WCF and VB.NET, spending tremendous amounts of resources to nowhere, instead of spending for something good. 

36 :  Without WCF we will either have to abandon a lot of the plans or suffer a decrease in productivity.  :-( 

37 :  It's possible you misunderstood the comment. 

38 :  Do I like being productive, absolutely. That means, never using WCF. 

39 :  The code has been already updated, but `7.19.0` did not include this. :( 

40 :  it seems you're a little too caffeinated here : 

41 :  Mike you are a valued JIT contributor 

42 :  I didn't really think about it too much. 

43 :  I didn't really think about it too much.  I was just trying to keep things peaceful here. 

44 :  I honestly believe that his harsh remarks were not intentional. 

45 :  It would be a great loss for the .NET community if you'd stop contributing. 

46 :  If you consider my comment to be negative, just tell me and I'll happily remove it. 

47 :  I did not contribute to get praise, I only contributed for the fun of it. And it stops being fun if I have to deal with nonsense. 

48 :  I can very much relate to that. 

49 :  But we need to be careful that we don't use valuable contributions as a currency to offset disrespectful behavior. 

50 :  Let's just say that it is distasteful. 

51 :  I honestly don't follow any more 

52 :  Sorry to hear that, but what is causing here an issue for you? 

53 :  It supposed to be a discussion so you can ask questions too. 

54 :  Then I quickly deleted it, as I recognized that it was not a helpful reaction and wouldn't help advance the conversation. 

55 :  So excuse me if this is how you felt. 

56 :  Seriously, have I done something to you? 

57 :  I encourage everyone to report this package to npm as its breaking their rules and harmful for npm ecosystem and its attacking users computer. 

58 :  Report it to npm 

59 :  Stop taking money for something that should be free and open. 

60 :  I hope that there is a more reasonable way of asking for funding since this practice will encourage many other projects to do the same and it would be unfortunate for our terminal output logs to look like nascar advertisements after everyone starts doing the same thing, which starts looking like the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). 

61 :  It is sad that so many with such strong opinions have no contributions in the last year outside of this issue. 

62 :  I don't want to have to view advertisements in my CI logs, and I hate what this would mean if other packages started doing this. 

63 :  I didn't mean to suggest that anyone disagreeing was acting as part of a mob. It was meant to apply specifically to those people treating a github issue like it's a place for trolling, nasty comments, etc. My apologies if it came off that way. 

64 :  Just be decent and follow the community's rules. 

65 :  If you are going to rant, go to twitter. 

66 :  Hopefully someone more well versed in this domain can help figure out what is going on. 

67 :  In the end, would be nice if these errors were caught and the users were notified of the GUI of what actions might be needed. 

68 :  Let's all be respectful. 

69 :  Take your foul mouthed trolling to Twitter. 

70 :  Find one that you are satisfied with and use it. 

71 :  Grow up and move along. 

72 :  I hate that these things never actually get fixed or resolved 

73 :  We're having a real problem with this because ESLint ignores the .eslintrc.json file (due to some other bug in ESLint), and it breaks the build. 

74 :  I understand you're upset and this rule is causing problems for you. 

75 :  I've found that it helps to clearly describe the problem I'm encountering and propose some solutions or ask questions to understand the problem space better. 

76 :  I empathize with your frustration 

77 :  Life is too short 

78 :  And the worst part is that I feel helpless to improve the situation. I vote, I campaign, I phone bank, I donate, I protest, I write to officials, I try to inform others... and yet things just keep getting worse and worse. 

79 :  Adding your political beliefs to your licensing is petty. The irony is that this very project is hosted on a resource owned by Microsoft... 

80 :  I'm not as familiar with the react code base (clearly from my comments) but if there's anything you need help on to get this going let me know 

81 :  They haven't commented on any of the related issues and they've been open for months. 

82 :   @_ing from the react team to get some on this? Seems to be quite a lot of interest, but not a single issue on this topic has received a comment from a maintainer in 5 months. 

83 :  Just wanted to chime in and say I strongly feel the same way - it would be at least good to get a hey we won't be considering this"." 

84 :  I know this wasn't your intention 

85 :  I'm really feeling stupid for not being able to figure this one out :( 

86 :  Though I am confident that my analysis is decent enough, much of the code I was referencing was unfamiliar/new to me. 

87 :  I'm not experienced that, but I'll use it for a while to see what happens. 

88 :  If I'm misunderstanding what is being requested here, please let me know. 

89 :  And this whole text could be avoided if you guys simple had said:  yeah that was a bad idea, i will try to put your suggestion in a next changelog or add some tool to convert json/xml then json/plist and any other technology RC lays on"" 

90 :  It would be nice to have shift+insert or Ctrl+shift+insert to have a linux like feeling or ctrl+shift+c and ctrl+shift+v like powershell does 

91 :  I apologise if I've misread any of the code. 

92 :  feel free to point out what I said that was even remotely an attack on *anyone* or an assumption of motivations? 

93 :  I shouldn't have even posted the above, but I couldn't resist throwing my two cents in - sorry! 

94 :  I worry about the racial discrimination have happened in US from long time ago to recent as a human being, while I also insist to regard `blacklist, whitelist, blackbox testing, whitebox testing, master, slave, etc` to be neutral nouns in `IT area` as a software engineer. 

95 :  Indeed, that shows my attitude about racial discrimination and mercy about people who suffer from brutality all around the world. 

96 :  Don't let word game anesthetize us, If everyone pays attention, discrimination will slowly disappear, but if we pretend that it has disappeared now, it may exist forever, The more one tries to hide, the more one is exposed. 

97 :  Whatever your strategic decision for Godot is, it's totally legit. I'm here only to defend bgfx from false statements. 

98 :  Imploring maintainers of an open source software is not going to yield the best results, I think. 

99 :  Don't forget about those instagals! :dancer: 

100 :  stop trying to read the motivations of someone you don't know. 

101 :  I'm happy to keep the discussion going, so don't take this as a negative sign. 

102 :  Follow the steps and put this script tag in the head tag. I'm not sure what else Yandex needs, but this is generally how google adsense works. 

103 :  we want to also be kind in how we request help from the core maintainers of Gatsby. 

104 :  Try to push the cause in Seattle ,) 

105 :  there is a lot of politics behind all these huge software/hardware infrastructures... :-( 

106 :  By soon", do you mean before ______? ( _insert funny sarcasm here_ )." 

107 :  I do hope they are working on a hip backend, not a full fork. That would be sad and only split the working effort. 

108 :  Sorry if the above came out sounding rude, just trying to clarify my position above! 

109 :  This is not Twitter or your Facebook wall... :-) 

110 :  I'm very sad about the abandon of GPU support for macOS. 

111 :  Using GPU acceleration locally on my MacBook Pro or future iMac Pro would be awesome. 

112 :  (yeah, the syntax looks like some sort of incantations or something ,-)) 

113 :  Sorry, nevermind. I made a mess out of it :D. My config was not in order, 

114 :  I'm not a Webpack guru myself 

115 :  So many different solutions, so many different workable options, yet none of them helped me in the past 3 hours getting bootstrap up and running... 

116 :  stop wasting our time. 

117 :  This is the worst framework i have ever seen. 

118 :  I have real project with Angular, and the only thing i get while developing - is the hurting. Tons of hurt i get. 

119 :  when you deal with real big scale project - the hurt is the only thing you get. 

120 :  Go home 

121 :  Let's not make the person who runs a massive open source project almost by himself job harder than it needs to be 

122 :  I read you... I am a Software Engineer, I am that senior level guy you speak of... I have cried out Angular pains in the past. 

123 :  So, sorry I don't have small debate points and I don't blame you for having your point of view. 

124 :  I feel your points. They burn us, too. 

125 :  My hope is that the team gets back to productive boosting features as soon as the dirty plumbing is done. And no need for another major rewrite (Router4?) 

126 :  I hope in the future Angular will become even better and easier to understand. 

127 :  I will step away and unfollow understanding how my mouth often gets me in trouble. 

128 :  make sure that even if using `vh`/`vw` etc, that there's a component for font sizing tied to something else like `px`/`rem`/`em`. 

129 :  I am really sorry if I break any rules. 

130 :  I'm struggling about passive reaction of Flutter team. 

131 :  feel misled because everything I first saw on homepage etc, promised 60 FPS and native performance. I think its bordering on unethical to not make this problem clearly known to new developers. 

132 :  I wish it was paid so we would not get the its free, whatever you get be happy response. 

133 :  At least we would not get a 100 line code commit after 1 year on such a huge issue. 

134 :  So there's nothing concrete that's being done yet? 

135 :  Are there really users that like to keep tabs only on specific parts, like indent? 

136 :  I'd like to voice my displeasure towards two trends going on in Visual Studio editor since VS 2015 

137 :  Finally, I'd appreciate if there was some workaround for this spaces instead of tabs issue, it's driving me nuts. 

138 :  Shouldn't the above satisfy everyone involved? 

139 :  Maybe that is somehow my fault because English is not my primary language and what I wrote is hard to understand, but in all honesty I am not sure what are you arguing for (or against). 

140 :  I am really surprised to hear that something like that cannot be done while still keeping all current options. 

141 :  I'm happy to clarify any of my points. 

142 :  If you'd like another venue to discuss things (perhaps in realtime) I'm also happy to use gitter or discord to continue the discussion :) 

143 :  it may be what you want, but it may be wrong for other users complaining about something similar. 

144 :  I certain see how it can be a bug. 

145 :  Unfortunately though, we've now had this new system a long time, and we are wary about subjecting people to more potential changes in behavior, esp. as it might fix this issue, only to cause problems for others :-/ 

146 :  I don't disagree with that, but there seems to be great resistance to even acknowlege that the behaviour has changed at some point, and that it doesn't seem correct, from a users point of view, that selecting **Always keep TABs** means **Always keep TABs except sometimes they will be changed to spaces** 

147 :  I don't disagree with that, 

148 :  If i've missed any points, i apologize. 

149 :  There's a lot being discussed here, and i likely missed it. 

150 :  I totally get that that can be frustrating. 

151 :  A group of people (that you are not a part of) is having their needs met, while yours are not. 

152 :  However, this really is a space where potential changes risk very bad outcomes for many groups. 

153 :  Again, I'm happy to help clarify any of my statements, or address any points i may have missed. 

154 :  I apologize for being rude 

155 :  At this point I am discouraged to report more because nothing ever seems to get fixed (usually because it's complicated")." 

156 :  I hope you prove me wrong and actually fix this issue, but I won't be holding my breath. 

157 :  I apologize in advance for the offtopic 

158 :  It is, lets say, disappointing that it sounds like Microsoft can't maintain it's code because it is too complex. 

159 :  If you just told me that this shouldn't be addressed because I was a nobody and my opinion wasn't important, I'd be annoyed, certainly, but overall less concerned. 

160 :  change the example 

161 :  give keybox to me now 

162 :  roll your own, pick another technology, or pay the bill. 

163 :  This makes it harder for newcomers to learn aspnet core without the support from the community or microsoft officially 

164 :  If you want to give us feedback on the pricing and explain your situation, this is not the right place to do that. 

165 :  I completely get that the IS devs neeed more money and want to be paid. 

166 :  I'm disappointed that such a basic functionality now requires lots of unplanned work and time. 

167 :  That's really sad. 

168 :  I'm not the guy who can actually judge what you're doing and why 

169 :  somehow like the whole OpenSource-Idea, no? ,) 

170 :  One must learn to pick his fights, so to speak. :) 

171 :  I'm sorry for any distress this experience has caused you. 

172 :  This feature should not be default, this should remain optional until all supported browsers handle it. 

173 :  please correct me if my assumption was incorrect 

174 :  I believe that, in this case, inclusive" means ~"how welcome someone ***feels*** in the angular community." The poster is _telling us_ that, in at least one case, someone doesn't feel like the angular community is inclusive." 

175 :  It also makes clear that, as a community, we do care about how welcome people feel and our issue is not with the _intent_ of the original post (to be more inclusive and thoughtful), but rather the execution. 

176 :  this seems to boil down to what percentage of the community/potential community might interpret `ng` as a slur."" 

177 :  bolster their suggestion by providing more examples or reasons why the interpretation the girl had is actually generally applicable. 

178 :  If I were evaluating this issue, I wouldn't care how many people interpret `ng-repeat` the way I intended, I'm interested in how many people interpret `ng-repeat` the way I *didn't* intend. 

179 :  Because of this, this issue strikes me as providing valuable feedback and I would encourage people to surface similar experiences that they may have had. 

180 :  I'm sorry to hear about your experience and I understand the sensitivity of your concern. 

181 :  Let us take some time to consider your request and respond in a mindful way. 

182 :  It was never our intention 

183 :  we will be very mindful of this problem when creating future APIs 

184 :  We the Angular team, strongly believe in building an inclusive community where everyone feels welcome, and we see how especially ng-repeat could be problematic in certain scenarios. 

185 :  Did you dislike the idea of solving it via a tickable option in the Options window? 

186 :  If the idea of putting it in the Options window is rejected, then I'm trying to brainstorm an alternative solution 

187 :  I personally don't feel like it's worth fixing myself, but i'd be happy to help you with a PR to change if it is something that is affecting you. 

188 :  Two minds being better than one and all that :) 

189 :  If that changes in the future, let me know. 

190 :  My offers of assistance seem to not be welcome 

191 :  It'd be great if a future version of Windows Terminal baked this in by default across all shells - it's really useful to have 

192 :  You can squint and imagine a merged feature that serves all the scenarios. 

193 :  It is very disappointed 

194 :  I've started thinking that Microsoft consider community opinion ... I am very disappointed 

195 :  I think to make right decision for this feature is to create a poll and ask people will they use this feature and would not be it annoying that exist two solutions: static methods and free functions ... 

196 :  And that's also normal that people who against it would like to have more acceptable reasoning or possibility of rethinking 

197 :  when I say stop with ... I really mean that _we're the ones responsible, at the end of the day._ Sorry about that, it sounded bad on a re-read. 

198 :  a few people have been asking me today about pip install 32 bit tensorflow support. 

199 :  Having the same problem here. Would really appreciate a fix 

200 :  then I am going to stop supporting Tensoeflow. 

201 :  We would appreciate a python 32bit fix, some distros install python 32 bit by default and there's no way around it 

202 :  A lot of my clients asking for this too. would appreciate a fix 

203 :  another one just asked me for a fix -_- 

204 :  more people have asked me private for a fix today 

205 :  Don't underestimate how difficult things like this are from a theoretical perspective. 

206 :  Lots of people here manage to be constructive and positive and I'd appreciate your effort in not starting fights with us or other contributors. 

207 :  Go and learn some manners! 

208 :  I've read about observable something, but why would I use the whole framework if I had to use another framework and do my own implementation? 

209 :  If they make fool of me it's not my fault 

210 :  So this means the whole framework is unpolished, untested and lazy coded. 

211 :  clearly you are feeling frustrated and angry right now. I can understand how that can happen. 

212 :  It is important that we work constructively to solve our problems and not resort to insults. 

213 :  I'm very sorry if this will cause you to leave Godot. 

214 :  I understand that some black people may not consider these terms offensive, but I would rather someone not want to work with me because they think I am too politically correct than because they think I am too insensitive and blind. 

215 :  Of course, if you @trivikr personally feel strongly about this then I support you :] 

216 :  If there's another way for this to work, I'm open to alternate ideas, but I think conditionally playbook imports would be generically useful. 

217 :  Please use the‘  button to let the maintainers know you need this feature. Getting a ton of emails from these +1s. 

218 :  I think you have a legitimate concern and I'm sorry if you feel like I'm ignoring you. 

219 :  I think you have a legitimate concern and I'm sorry if you feel like I'm ignoring you. 

220 :  do not you think that simply stating that I 'messed up writers" ' without explaining why is rude?" 

221 :  Look again, the name isn't Maui, the name is Multi-platform App UI which abbreviates to M.A.U.I. 

222 :  I hope this is not Microsoft's general attitude towards open source projects these days... 

223 :  bro I am an Open Source author and maintainer so don't try lecturing me about being against off-putting towards the open-source community"" 

224 :  That's not because others really love .NET, but because they try to stay constructive here. 

225 :  MauiKit whether you want to hear it or not has no fundamentals of what I as an Open Source Author and Maintainer would consider signs of a healthy project. 

226 :  We are talking about open source projects, there should be a common philosophy, not a competition for those who have the biggest issue counter. 

227 :  Sorry if I sounded harsh, that wasn't my intent. 

228 :  To be honest, this entire thread so far makes me far less inclined to introduce a dependency on the enterprise project. 

229 :  will have to move to a real open source tool like JMeter instead of gatling.  Sad. 

230 :  We are really sorry to hear this. 

231 :  Don't be so agitated 

232 :  For best outcome please consider writing your messages mindfully and calmly explaining both your problem and what is the suggested resolution or expectation for it. 

233 :  My sincere apologies.  I was in the wrong, and I've done you harm.  I'm sorry. 

234 :  Alex, sorry, I had gathered that you're recognized as the principle Windows maintainer. I didn't mean to invent a title. 

235 :  Well, I'm sorry for having been slightly edgy due to the total irrelevance of that statement with which he accompanies the news that he unblocked me. 

236 :  Let's be clear - you're telling *me* that I don't credit trade-offs or drawbacks, on a project I maintain, for a protocol that was designed a year ago, and for which noone has reported any automated breakage of any system, while still being able to migrate at the time of their choice. 

237 :  It's also been frustrating to be treated as a troll when I was called entitled but responded with a compliment. 

238 :  It was frustrating to see my point be misinterpreted as something else. 

239 :  I'm sorry if you felt your concern wasn't taken into consideration, I think it's simply because you believe, as you said, making future decisions based on trust is a mistake", while other people may not (I don't)." 

240 :  Think about that. 

241 :  I read some thoughtful and reasonable responses in this thread, and I understand how everyone has their point of view. 

242 :  Stop whining about that and remove the BLM from the site. 

243 :  grow some thicker skin and calm down. 

244 :  As a side note, the kind of errors hit by the users on the thread of this issue (lack of basic knowledge of Python for instance) tells me that we cannot solve their problem. 

245 :  He, being one of the top contributors to scikit-learn has to make tough decisions as to what will go into our codebase and what will not, as a more verbose documentation or tutorial might not be preferable for a lot of people. 

246 :  we understand your eagerness to solve your problem, and your frustration when it is not solved. 

247 :  I am very new in scikit-learn. 

248 :  I will be highly appreciated any useful advice. 

249 :  Sorry if this issue seems a bit salty, but it's really annoying 

250 :  I just lost hours worth of state because of this behavior. 

251 :  Just having automatic updates install upon next launch would be a perfectly fine behavior 

252 :  Unfortunately I am going to have to abandon it until this issue is fixed because I'm losing a lot of time and work every other week when an update is pushed and my long-running processes are lost. 

253 :  Don't act on theories! 

254 :  This is the second or third time I've been screwed over by Microsoft's shitty installation practices. 

255 :  The grass isn't greener on the other side... 

256 :  To be fair, @jeremylt, the 300hrs estimate was quite demotivating for me when I started. 

257 :  I don't believe anything I've said could fairly be labeled mansplaining, but I am sorry that I was curt 

258 :  This mistake is still haunting us years later, unfortunately. 

259 :  It's sad that I have to use such a long winded approach to try and defend its future and get certain parts of Microsoft to cooperate with other parts. 

260 :  Replace the template text and remove irrelevant text as the instruction says. 

261 :  I think it is more important that the main developer of Vim can concentrate on enhancing and improving Vim instead of having to change a workflow, that has been proven to be working well for the past 30 years. 

262 :  My words were met by defensiveness, ego, stubbornness, ignorance, and delusion. 

263 :  Starting a reply with the conversation is already over is not okay. 

264 :  Check out the web service to see how they want you to do it. If it's your own server, set it up properly. 

265 :  Make up your mind, updater… 

266 :  Have patience 

267 :  doesn't hurt to be polite. 

268 :  fork it, fix it, make a pull request and contribute. 

269 :  It seems here that Microsoft is taking an active approach to kill VB actively (as opposed to passive approach - just let it die by abandoning it). :-( 

270 :  I probably shouldn't make any more PR as they will fail. 

271 :  I feel my time creating that PR was wasted, so not rewarding, hence I'll think twice before making another PR. 

272 :  I feel my time creating that PR was wasted, so not rewarding, hence I'll think twice before making another PR. 

273 :  I'm sorry I don't have much time for other things beside work and family. 

274 :  I didn't realize a 4 line PR would pull me into a discussion on how to improve it by implementing a new code base and consequently figure why shippable would fail. 

275 :  I didn't realize a 4 line PR would pull me into a discussion on how to improve it by implementing a new code base and consequently figure why shippable would fail. 

276 :  Feel free do whatever you see fit, I'm off to other things, good luck & sorry for the noise. 

277 :  Feel free do whatever you see fit, I'm off to other things, good luck & sorry for the noise. 

278 :  I think it really has to do with time of day, traffic, alignment of the planets, etc. 

279 :  Sooooooooooooooo slowly :( 

280 :  My apologies for the frustration this issue has caused. 

281 :  It would be helpful if you could benchmark this with curl for reference. 

282 :  i wish Salt guys put the comments inside this source, listing all the bugs related to this module. 

283 :  i made quite many changes in that mounts.py - and now i am thinking about undoing almost all of them... Lack of any documentation... 

284 :  See... i know very little about Linux and nothing about Python, so i was googling everything i could think of :-) 

285 :  it is sad how fast you were to say Salt is all wrong and how protective you fet about OMV. 

286 :  Our customers have complained after opening the application for the first time :( 

287 :  Disappointing that this is not being considered high priority. 

288 :  Honestly, this issue made me re-consider of cross-platform frameworks being owned by the same company (Google here) will be supported at best, and ignoring quality metrics delivery on other platforms (iOS). 

289 :  The project needs lifesaving measures as it's community is dissatisfied enough to be discussing forks. 

290 :  Issues where opened and closed by the bot without any reponse, and nobody but you can do some critical things (merging pull requests, publishing fixes...). 

291 :  I hope people keep that vision in mind, when considering the near-term goals like providing prompt feedback directly on GitHub discussions, quick resolution for user-contributed PRs, maintenance releases etc. 

292 :  I do continue to feel pretty disappointed that the active project ownership that is so badly is still not coming in the near term. 

293 :  I agree your mind but really sad about results...  :-| 

294 :  PS : sorry for my poor english, frenchies are really bad with it :-) 

295 :  I love you Jack, for making SUI. I just hope you dont get crazy <3 

296 :  At the same time I must mention one thing: **you will not succeed on your own**. 

297 :  In that regard I find it highly confusing - and disrespectful imho - that you chose to ignore all suggestions to delegate power to trusted contributors who would like to help you to maintain SUI 2.x. 

298 :  PS: You will still be the captain ,) 

299 :  If you're just going to hack around with low level packets, then just use netty and don't bother us when things break. 

300 :  I understand that it won't be accepted, I'm not contesting that. 

301 :  be kind 

302 :  As a consumer of your product, I expect it to work as advertised 

303 :  So our apologies if some things take too long, or don't end up happening 

304 :  but it's wrong to blame the maintainers for this. 

305 :  Well I'm having trouble making a reproducer for this. 

306 :  it would be great if there was a built-in way to paginate a list Jekyll collection items on a page. 

307 :  it would be nice if there was a built in pagniation that worked for both post and collection items. 

308 :  would like to see Nested Collections. 

309 :  I would like to see [reading metadata in separate files] 

310 :  I would like to see the tags of collections included in site.tags. 

311 :  build in support for content blocks and components 

312 :  I'd very much love to have native support for Coffeescript in much the same manner as Sass. 

313 :  it would be great to have more interactions with github, like pulling profile information (contributions, avatar, ), releases data - and convert it for proper publication. 

314 :  I would like to see an automated tool like Webpack integrated into Jekyll to handle Sass and Javascript. 

315 :  I'd love to see Docker volume mounts work with Jekyll and Docker for Windows. 

316 :  I would love to see an offically supported page generator from data files. 

317 :  Make internal linking easier. 

318 :  Dont work with fb and google 

319 :  This is not the level of security awareness I expect Microsoft to have. 

320 :  work with your security teams to get the uploader qualified by at least the major vendors 

321 :  A company that does not understand the need of a full doc do not will offer a serious support in the long time 

322 :  Close this issue 

323 :  It would be nice to at least give an explanation before just closing an issue, this way nothing will get resolved, 

324 :  It would be nice to at least give an explanation before just closing an issue, this way nothing will get resolved, 

325 :  Wondering if Terminal users are mentally prepared to such amount of social activity in their lives.. switching from 0 social life to this directly might be... Overwhelming 

326 :  It's a fun-take and I wanted to upvote it for the fun part, but then I thought it may send the wrong message so I had to downvote it, just to not confuse newcomers. ,) 

327 :  The removal of the santa hat, and kowtowing to a fake user, is incredibly offensive to me. 

328 :  When I updated my VSCode, it was gone. 

329 :  If you don't do it I'll feel sad and disappointed. 

330 :  I'm deeply sorry for my insensitivity. 

331 :  Bring back the Santa's hat! 

332 :  I liked the santa hat, it brought a little joy to my day. Very sad that it has been removed. 

333 :  bring the hat back 

334 :  Bring back the hat. 

335 :  Put a satan hat back. 

336 :  add a Satan Hat! 

337 :  Assuming he was trolling: troll successful, gg 

338 :  I'm also not happy that the santa hat was removed, completely ignoring the public opinion here on GH. 

339 :  I def understand how frustrated you are, but every new platform has its shares of issues and stability. 

340 :  I understand you're frustrated, but having a positive attitude, even when you're stressed out or frustrated speaks volumes to others who are genuinely trying to help. 

341 :  Instead, when are you going to add REAL support for streaming?? 

342 :  I'm almost 40, and I bet I'm gonna die BEFORE you even get the idea to implement all of this!!! Pfffff............... 

343 :  that is painful 

344 :  Embrace the patterns of the npm ecosystem. 

345 :  Could you show me how to resolve this issue please? 

346 :  fork lerna and do it yourself. 

347 :  what a waste of time. 

348 :  We are talking things technically, don't make it personal. 

349 :  Calm down 

350 :  If you feel disrespect on nasty", I apologize." 

351 :  I think, you have many professional developers and why this F... RTL problem is not important for you? 

352 :  Why atom team don't like to fix this issue? 

353 :  Microsoft products are phenomenally bad and it's a wonder how you guys still stay in business. 

354 :  I suspect your whiteboarding hiring technique is ineffective and counterproductive. 

355 :  What's so special about installing .NET Core that it requires a different installation strategy? 

356 :  WTF? 

357 :  GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER MICROSOFT!!!! 

358 :  If I sound harsh, it's because I am sick and tired of Microsoft releasing half-baked products that don't work as expected. 

359 :  I would feel sorry for you guys like I would for the slow kid who klutzes around the basketball court, but this isn't your first time on the court with years of effort and tons of resources. 

360 :  It's why your own developers are using MacBook Pros for development. 

361 :  Telling us you are frustrated is fine, ranting is not. 

362 :  This is the kind of coding quality we get when corporations prioritizes employee diversity over code quality 

363 :  A thumbs down isn't enough on this one. There's zero tolerance for backwater attitude. Reporting. 

364 :  If people like me and you don't attempt it then we can wait another 3 years without anyone else picking the issue up. 

365 :  I am frankly fed up with this posture in open source projects. 

366 :  I've abandoned (a long time ago) the port effort and don't even use Dart anymore and will stop watching this rep. 

367 :  Why would I post this on the community site? I'm experiencing this problem on the travis-ci.com website?? 

368 :  you are showing how unappreciative and ignorant you can be. 

369 :  You can fault the devs for not getting this right with modules from the start, but aside from that, you should have more awareness of reality and what these changes have required before sharing those types of crass comments. 

370 :  In fact, you should probably not use any open source software, as the type of comment you left above are one of the major reasons why application developers give up on open source. 

371 :  Just because the software is open source doesn't mean we aren't paying for it. 

372 :  I honestly cannot believe how casual and dismissive you guys at MS are. 

373 :  I understand it must really difficult to do your job as a $1.75T company but can you try? 

374 :  Seeing you are happy to close issues and never respond to replies in closed issues, I am forced to open new issue. 

375 :  I would like to remind you that we are a small team of maintainers, and it has been less than or barely 24 hours since I responded to your issue yesterday. 

376 :  Telling users that they can use DSX but can't use debugger or enjoy auto-complete is a non starter for me. 

377 :  you are mixing everything I say and this conversation is going nowhere. In legal terms you are Badgering the witness"." 

378 :  I just don't have the time for this here. 

379 :  You failed to grasp that XML parsing (with some extra code to skip '{}' properly) is orders of magnitude simpler than fully parsing a programming language like Dart. 

380 :  you should invest you time and energy in writing up convincing arguments. 

381 :  You guys are suffering from NIH syndrome (Not-invented-here). Good artists copy, great artists steal", mediocre artists, well, behave like you." 

382 :  Really !!! nobody seems to bother to explain what exactly Flutter would gain... blah blah blah"." 

383 :  I don't want to argue against the feature but comments like if you don't do x then horribly y will happen" are just ridiculous." 

384 :  I think you underestimate how willing people are to try things, even when they're not fully polished. 

385 :  Obviously you didn't take my hint on length to heart but don't come to conclusions about my character because you don't know me at all. 

386 :  It is obvious to me that you are not very experienced with JSX, you really don't understand how it works. 

387 :  You are not the meter used to measure success and you don't know what I am up to. 

388 :  You equate me not having much experience with JSX and me not knowing how it works at all? 

389 :  my point still stands - that kind of comment is _still_ not appropriate here. 

390 :  Women can also be a construction worker  

391 :  This is the worst piece of advice anyone can give. 

392 :  Are you a I am the greatest dev alive" guy?" 

393 :  because if you even pause for a second to contemplate yes to any of those things you have a very rude awakening coming. 

394 :  It would also have been nice if you gave some actual reasoning behind your comment, not just flaming. 

395 :  I think I would rather become a rice farmer than ever touch WCF again. 

396 :  This is another good reason to not support WCF. Years of people implementing designs using WCF based on false assumptions or mythical functionality. 

397 :  If you don't like it, don't use it!!! 

398 :  Why try and stop others from using it? and most importantly why do so with absolutely no information just flaming? sorry but show me, tell me why? 

399 :  So, if this way of doing things is so terrible tell me why, don't just talk smack. Facts, Proof, Scientific Method... 

400 :  **I ask kindly post something informative and factual or just stop trolling.** 

401 :  Berating them to move to REST when it's impossible for them is neither clever nor helpful. 

402 :  This was last discussed more than five years ago and should be discussed again. 

403 :  for support reasons, you don't really have to ask what platform they're on, just mention the three paths in one sentence, it's actually rather easy. 

404 :  You're being a bit facetious. 

405 :  The third silly thing is that you're acting like IPython doesn't have any changes that break some pieces of code or tutorials out there. 

406 :  All in all it makes your comment seem more like irrational stubbornness than actual concerns. 

407 :  There's no need to update all the code and documentation all over the internet", nobody has every done that and never will." 

408 :  Now if it's to criticize the code without proper understanding of the technical and social reason of why it is the way it is, and bring XDG zealotry into the mix, I'm even less likely to make an effort. 

409 :  Also, your explanation still makes zero sense It's just re-identify the id if change" isn't even a proper sentence." 

410 :  Listen to his comment and stop suggesting this crudely thought-up bandaid of a fix"." 

411 :  Just PLEASE STOP. 

412 :  Care to explain why did you deleted my comment? 

413 :  Because it was completely inappropriate. Telling other contributors to not comment because you have no clue what you're talking about" is toxic behavior." 

414 :  Telling other contributors to not comment because you have no clue what you're talking about" is toxic behavior." 

415 :  While your contributions are clearly valuable, you need to accept that you're part of a larger community and need to treat others with respect. 

416 :  As such I don't care about what the code of conduct says because anyway I don't plan to contribute more work to this OSS project. 

417 :  Well, I consider his behavior to show a lack of respect for other's people work and time. 

418 :  Well, I appreciate they're appreciated but at the same time I don't really care. 

419 :  Nobody appreciates random/out of context quoting, straightforward answer avoidance, jumping to conclusions and whatnot. 

420 :  Working for fun doesn't imply that you get to do whatever you want and that there are no consequences. 

421 :  You shield yourself in the code of conduct and go OMG, how could people dare telling me that I'm wrong? 

422 :  Or perhaps you try to do better next time and avoid the not so fun part of messing up? 

423 :  And if you really do not know what you are talking about then what? 

424 :  Instead of an answer I've got some gibberish that tries to pass as code review or whatever that is supposed to be. 

425 :  It's exactly this unwillingness to learn from mistakes that brought us here. 

426 :  Feel free to continue to go down this path, the only thing you'll achieve is to dig the hole deeper. 

427 :  Yet here you are, telling me exactly that. 

428 :  Telling him that he doesn't know what he's talking about is unacceptable. 

429 :  If you want other people to learn, you need to give them more information beyond you're wrong"." 

430 :  You're basically sending him the signal of you're not welcome here"." 

431 :  if we observe behavior like this in the future, we'll ultimately block you. 

432 :  We can't have other contributors stop engaging with us because of your behavior. While your contributions are valued, they don't warrant losing other contributors as collateral damage. 

433 :  But instead of apologizing or even just letting that feedback sink in, you're now trying to turn the tables by saying you got victimized by Tanner because he asked you a technical question and that it's unreasonable from our end to ask you to be respectful in your responses to him. 

434 :  But instead of apologizing or even just letting that feedback sink in, you're now trying to turn the tables by saying you got victimized by Tanner because he asked you a technical question and that it's unreasonable from our end to ask you to be respectful in your responses to him. 

435 :  Oh, you gotta be joking. 

436 :  If you do not follow - can you ask other collaborators for help? 

437 :  Great attitude, especially as a _fastlane_ collaborator. Why not say it in here publicly? 

438 :  So instead of having a discussion and providing a counter example or presenting **any** reasoning why something would not be implemented, you are just discouraging people from helping _fastlane_... 

439 :  This is highly inappropriate. 

440 :  Do you really wonder why I don't want to spend any more time helping you? 

441 :  Mentioning other contributors that have not participated in the discussion is inappropriate as well, by the way. 

442 :  I do not think that looking for help in other contributors was inappropriate in that case as you clearly didn't want to take care of this issue. 

443 :  If people started paying for packages then they would be a lot more careful about the crap they select. 

444 :  YOU choose to spend your time on this project. 

445 :  If you aren't willing to contribute your code or your ideas to open source and aren't willing to contribute to projects monetarily, you should consider tempering your views. 

446 :  You guys seriously don't see what this guy is doing? He's trying to push his ESLint config as a standard" and monetize it." 

447 :  Not when that feedback is 100% predicable because it's nothing but our inner two year old being triggered to whine when everything doesn't go 100% his or her way. 

448 :  To place a copyleft licence on the work and then complain that you can't monetize it because people are copying it for free is an... interesting complaint. 

449 :  What an awful and misleading name for a eslint config. 

450 :  No, not all humans have this reaction.  The reaction you are projecting on all humans infers that all humans are greedy, inconsiderate thieves. 

451 :  Not letting your inner two year old rule you does not mean he is not present.  His complaints are predictable, and those who are voicing complaints from him are not needed. 

452 :  Please take your pseudo-intellectual garbage elsewhere 

453 :  Calling people triggered whining two-year olds doesn't contribute to this discussion constructively. 

454 :  should be ashamed of himself. 

455 :  It would be appreciable and civilized if you stopped calling the other's point of view &mdash, or the point of view you think they hold &mdash, stupid"." 

456 :  It would be appreciable and civilized if you stopped calling the other's point of view &mdash, or the point of view you think they hold &mdash, stupid"." 

457 :  Even worse, you don't seem to try to understand the other side point of view, and rush to your own conclusions. 

458 :  You move from **assumptions**,  **contracts** to **communicating**. 

459 :  Comparisons to Hitler are neither necessary nor welcome here, and anyone unable to debate the merits of *versioning schemes* without relying on that as a rhetorical device should rethink whether their participation here is going to lead to a constructive conversation. 

460 :  Is Microsoft's official answer to reporting a serious performance regression in a subsystem used every day by developers and admins who are managing and maintaining their user base really yeah we are aware of it but whether we will fix it and when, who knows"?" 

461 :  if you're unhappy with how the console is performing, go ahead and switch back to legacy mode. 

462 :  Don't struggle with this, Mike.  Again, if your mythical twenty year old stuff" doesn't work with the new Windows 10 console, by all means, use the old console, link in ANSICON, and keep relying on monkeypatching GetProcAddress (euughhhh)." 

463 :  In other words you want someone else to do the work for you „ 

464 :  You got the report and the working samples. 

465 :  So in your opinion you're free to mess it up, isn't it? 

466 :  Grow up first! 

467 :  Please stop collecting MY data and remove telemetry from all your f**g Windows products. 

468 :  Be thankful. Microsoft uses the data to improve your calculating experience. :smile: 

469 :  Just hoping Microsoft will not put backdoor, telemetry, obfuscation and all its shit in all Github projects, like others did in SourceForge. 

470 :  Just because a product is open-sourced doesn't mean you can go around making demands in this manner. 

471 :  I don't respect people who want to collect my PRIVATE data with software. 

472 :  If you don't like my demand, delete it. 

473 :  If you want better software, delete all these malwares. 

474 :  Because everybody today is speaking on the Net about a Windows Calculator with telemetry inside. I didn't believe even that was possible and... yes. 

475 :  What isn't respectful is polluting the issue-catalog with useless rants, poorly hidden profanity and shouting. 

476 :  I am, however, done with this issue now. 

477 :  you guys are worried about what data the calculator is collecting? what about the rest of windows lol 

478 :  You are not Calculator King of the Internet. 

479 :  A lot of time is being wasted doing what I've already done. 

480 :  The only negative opinions I get are from trolls or people who need an excuse for why they suck at the game. 

481 :  I do NOT need to upgrade, you miss the point. 

482 :  Avoiding Win10 is intentional, because I don't want my PC to have buggy, ugly, spying rubbish. 

483 :  I however suspect your comments are a little disingenuous 

484 :  you are entitled to believe what you like, but Windows 7 is coming to an end, and if you do not wish to remain a Windows user, there is macOS and various forms of Linux, for you to choose from. 

485 :  This isn't some Reddit thread for you to vent. 

486 :  Shortly, it's THE WORST system MS made (after Millenium). 

487 :  That's why I feel disappointed(angry) that you support Win10 and WITHOUT ANY REASON drop support for Win7. 

488 :  And funny, but NOT A SINGLE ANSWER were given by... hm... professionals"." 

489 :  You really need to take a step back and consider how you present yourself publicly. 

490 :  I have no desire to provide a professional response based on your attitude. 

491 :  This is absolutely unacceptable behavior 

492 :  Whoever came up with this idea clearly doesn't understand why ESLint was created in the first place. 

493 :  There are plenty of domains where you would like to give a function a name beginning with use"." 

494 :  You're not paying for it and the maintainers of this tool don't owe you anything. 

495 :  When you do post a complaint, you'll maximize your chances of getting what you want by avoiding incendiary language like absolutely unacceptable", "screaming", "atrocious", "carelessly", and "doesn't understand"." 

496 :  what's fuck google do? flutter is yours,golang is yours, why can't they live together? 

497 :  @akien-mga and other contributors.. get your shit together 

498 :  Whether it was a mistake or not is not decided by you, but the community as a whole. 

499 :  You are not the center of the universe. 

500 :  I have no idea what you are so angry about, just chill man. 

501 :  the only way someone can convince someone else to work on something on this project is good arguments from one side and the will to do it from the other side. 

502 :  you come off as quite hostile. 

503 :  I feel like I've seen you troll (that's what your comments amount to really) other GitHub projects also but I won't bother to check. Life is too short‹» 

504 :  you also completely dodged my point about the smiley emoji implementations. so i recommend a good feature for the engine **(inventory and other 2d stuff, that ALL GAME DEVELOPERS WILL BENEFIT FROM)**, but **you spit in my face**, claim that it's not low level enough", but then go around merging PRs for "emoji smiley" support for fonts? that's somehow still low level though? wtf??" 

505 :  so much for open source"." 

506 :  wtf?? 

507 :  can't have discussions without bypassing  / cheating github it seems! 

508 :  it's really hard for me to sit back and ignore what these companies are doing with my code. 

509 :  I have trouble expressing how angry this makes me feel. 

510 :  Do parents" who drag their children across the desert with the express intent of illegally entering the United States have no share of blame for what happens to these children?" 

511 :  It says nothing about people giving money to e.g. Microsoft or using Microsoft products. 

512 :  Maybe they would have dropped in to tell us it won't be accepted and not to waste any effort on it? 

513 :  go listen to them and stop relying on those soulless motherfuckers at Facebook to give a damn about you. 

514 :  to be honest, this response is borderline unacceptable and I don't even know what to reply. Wow. 

515 :  What the actual hell is your goal here? 

516 :  You're screwing Lerna, not the companies listed 

517 :  Meanwhile you're getting massive community backlash that's only going to continue if you decide to be a child and inappropriately release this as a minor version bump or with the MIT license. 

518 :  The best thing feasible for Lerna at this point is you leaving the project 

519 :  The best thing feasible for Lerna at this point is you leaving the project 

520 :  the second best thing is everyone moving to a fork of the project without a politician having any control. 

521 :  The irony is I 100% agree with your politics, but this is not the place to express them. 

522 :  it sucks if I have to spend my evening checking a bunch of old repos because you'll _maybe_ release this as a patch. 

523 :  So I fucked off and told them to eat shit. 

524 :  Once upon a time I thought I had to go work for those big corporations that I hate in order to do the kind of open source work I want to do. That turned out to be incredibly false. So I fucked off and told them to eat shit. 

525 :  If you want to restrict who can use lerna, then lerna can no longer be called free, it will be proprietary. 

526 :  Calls for civility are perfectly apt after an issue like this. Suggesting that asking people to be nice" is an attempt at ending discussion is one of the strangest stretches I've ever heard. As someone that called maintainers cowards for reverting the changes and removing Jamie, I can get a strong sense of why you'd argue that point, however." 

527 :  do you really want transparency, or are you looking for a fight? 

528 :  If you're looking for rancorous sniping and harmful drama" you might try using a mirror." 

529 :  Explain how me, the person who made the decision, not employed by Microsoft, was secretly paid by Microsoft to ruin open source. Should be an amusing story. 

530 :  So for all this grandstanding you're doing -- why not delete your GitHub account...seriously -- MS will own GitHub soon. Also -- change your OS from Windows -- if you use that... 

531 :  Oh Jesus nevermind -- I'm an idiot I guess :joy: -- apologies :) 

532 :  Sure, I'm sure you could argue Adolf was a pretty cool guy if you ignore all the other stuff he did and just focus on his gun control policy. ”¥ 

533 :  This is really frustrating 

534 :  This is stupid! 

535 :  There is a bug here and posting that this is fixed is misleading. 

536 :  Honest question: does anybody read what I've been posting about this issue? 

537 :  Did you actually read the thread? 

538 :  The problem is nbot the ability to permanently remove files, please the first message of the issue... It's explicit. 

539 :  You assumed the most common error was because `gvfs-trash` was not installed. 

540 :  This thread is the proof it's no more the case. Please, update. 

541 :  I would direct people to actually read the bug report before commenting. 

542 :  Well great let me just ship your computer around so everyone can use it. 

543 :  Or even better we will buy everyone a plane ticket and then can come stand in line to use your computer where the software does work. 

544 :  I dont understand why people working for google have such a problem admting they make mistakes...  everybody does, what makes difference is fix them or not. 

545 :  i cant even imagine a meeting to present the product: Here we have a new tool that will allow developers to set constants remotelly, helping with A/B tests and allowing the developer to change apps behavior without re-deploy." 

546 :  You just told me that if someone has an app in both architectures and want to use the default values THIS PERSON MUST DEFINE EVERY FIELD 3 TIMES... does it sound smart? 

547 :  I hate to be rude and also hate to teach people how to do their jobs. but this architecture design of firebase RC is a clear mistake, anyone with a basic software engineer understand should be able to see that. 

548 :  I'm sorry to tell you but this isnt frustrating" this is a super stupid architecture design..." 

549 :  This is very much a case of Old Microsoft" rearing it's head, rather then new forward looking Microsoft." 

550 :  We can disagree here and have debates, but please halt yourself before assuming the motivations of others and attacking individuals personally or their work. 

551 :  If you're unhappy with them, you're absolutely free to change them. 

552 :  did you perhaps recognise the truth of what I wrote and felt defensive? 

553 :  I am so tempted to chime in with something more confrontational but I don't think it'll add to the debate 

554 :  if you expect it to meet all your needs straight away you probably need to realign your expectations. 

555 :  you're getting a little extreme. 

556 :  Good recommendation, but the you'll sound like Yoda" is too informal for a disclaimer." 

557 :  **I REALLY DISAGREE WITH THIS PR** 

558 :  This is actually nonsensical statement. 

559 :  you are being overly defensive when the whole argument was about Godot, not BGFX. 

560 :  You seem to be assuming that just because of adding BGFX support, everything will be fine and no one will ever have to learn how the underlying APIs work. 

561 :  thanks a lot for your enthusiasm, but I am the one doing the rendering work in Godot, not you. 

562 :  As always with Godot, you are free to make your own renderer with BGFX, show me that it's flawless, has better better performance, works better than mine (of course while supporting the full Godot feature set) and uses less resources and code to prove me wrong.. as well as commiting full time over the next years to maintain it. 

563 :  If you want a revolution, begin with it yourself. 

564 :  If you want to prove your ideas, invest in them because words are free. 

565 :  What a classic example of elitism and douchebaggery. 

566 :  I will stay miles away from Godot and any projects you maintain, thanks. 

567 :  I will stay miles away from Godot and any projects you maintain, thanks. 

568 :  Nobody's saying it shouldn't use the network. 

569 :  It just shouldn't use the network *before the user has given it permission*, because otherwise it is a **data leak**. 

570 :  That's *why the consent dialog exists*. 

571 :  That seems to be a recurring issue 

572 :  You need to reopen this one too, because, inconvenient or not, autoupdate checks are also an inadvertent form of telemetry *whether the project uses them for the purpose or not*. 

573 :  It doesn't matter if the telemetry is coming from the telemetry package" or not." 

574 :  As already stated, if that form of telemetry" is an issue for you feel free to block the network access or create a version of Atom that doesn't check for updates." 

575 :  What about the thousands of other users who haven't spent time and money on things like Little Snitch, who nevertheless don't want to be tracked and explicitly opt out of telemetry that still get telemetry sent (and logged by their government forever) against their wishes? 

576 :  If you're going to insist on the autoupdate thing, couldn't you just do it once per month, at a random number of cumulative hours delay (say, 1-12) after startup, so that it doesn't function as an ad hoc user has launched the app" telemetry event to everyone watching and logging the network?" 

577 :  If you're going to insist on the autoupdate thing, couldn't you just do it once per month, at a random number of cumulative hours delay (say, 1-12) after startup, so that it doesn't function as an ad hoc user has launched the app" telemetry event to everyone watching and logging the network?" 

578 :  As I have stated multiple times you can definitely work with Atom while offline (or with network requests blocked). 

579 :  I do think that while delivered in a dictatorial manner, comment is worth discussing more. 

580 :  Aww.. Here, have a beer on me: :beer: 

581 :  There is also room now to put Google Ads in the exception messages. 

582 :  If you, or somebody else, think Node.js *should* address one of the particular concerns, and are willing to help in making that happen, Im sure we can arrange that. :slightly_smiling_face: 

583 :  Largely a duplicate of #19826 from earlier this year.  The answer is still 'no'. 

584 :  If you don't have anything relevant to say, stay quiet 

585 :  Your heavy-handed and dismissive approach to moderation diminishes the project and the whole community. 

586 :  Just because you are afraid taking responsibility doesn't mean someone else won't step up to it. 

587 :  Just because you are afraid taking responsibility doesn't mean someone else won't step up to it. 

588 :  You suck at it. 

589 :  it's bullshit solution. 

590 :  It's hard to predict what you want, because it's not clear what you want. 

591 :  Jesus, I wish you guys STFU and get back to work instead. 

592 :  Too bad maintainers do not mute the thread. 

593 :  I'll have to unsubscribe from the ticket because it's unbearable to get emails with flame wars. 

594 :  I've been spending WAY too much time on adding bootstrap 4 with npm to a webpack project. 

595 :  I just installed, included, imported and my app just runs fine, no errors, but yet no col-md or container styling working.. meh, i'll just return to CDN's... 

596 :  But also, I don't want to be mean but I would prefer not to have this kind of discussions. 

597 :  This is once again NOT a bug and it is up to you to now change the way you deal with your animations. 

598 :  If you don't want to call it a bug, it's very bad design at the very least. 

599 :  I am **once again**, going to explain how the frame property works within the engine: you select a frame, which is numbered from left to right, then from top to bottom. 

600 :  And once again, there is nothing to fix here, unless you have a real solution" to the problem." 

601 :  we won't solve your problem by introducing workarounds in the code, sorry. 

602 :  What the hell? 

603 :  Your issue doesn't contain a single bit of useful information anybody could act on. 

604 :  At best the problem is that your expectations are wrong and you blame Angular instead of adjusting yourself, and the worse case is that you are just spreading spam. 

605 :  Angular works great for most. If it doesn't for you it's highly likely the problem is on your end. 

606 :  You need to stop acting like 3-year old. 

607 :  You need to stop acting like 3-year old. 

608 :  Grow up, get your sh*t together and stop spamming. 

609 :  don't cry, contributor, you are not blame that you are into that sh*t 

610 :  the reality is just opposite, it is the very suitable framework especially for real big projects. Just to guess, your problem is probably that you see it / try to use it by the same way as from jQuery point of view which is totally wrong way. 

611 :  whats the problem to answer this question? 

612 :  I don't even understand what the problem is and you don't seem to be interested to explain it. 

613 :  I don't even understand what the problem is and you don't seem to be interested to explain it. 

614 :  LOL - you simply closed my issue - where is your interest? 

615 :  LOL - you simply closed my issue - where is your interest? 

616 :  Because you do not know the answer about the raw response in gitter? 

617 :  I don't even care if that is directly in your code or was pulled in via a dependency bump. 

618 :  I'd say that's much worse than a temporarily broken build. 

619 :  I'm sorry my fuckups have caused you pain. 

620 :  And even if you do feel there is responsibility, you should not be so rude. 

621 :  Unintended breaking changes happen, but blaming it on the consumers is not an appropriate response. 

622 :  your reaction to the mistake being brought to your intention is somewhere between condescending and hostile. 

623 :  Instead you said that it's good that your mistake broke my build. 

624 :  You could have said sorry, this was not intended, let me roll back and re-release as 4.0.0" and it would be fine." 

625 :  You could have said sorry, I didn't consider that the yargs API practically becomes part of the lerna API, I will make sure that future SemVer major updates of yargs only happen in SemVer major updates of lerna"" 

626 :  However, I do see much evidence that you are trying to crash through head first through Angular and I see it as you feel it should just work the way you want it to... 

627 :  You either consume it all OR you will be wingin' it" and fighting the current of how things actually work versus how you want them to work." 

628 :  **angular team doesn't care about users feedback at all** 

629 :  Soooooooooooo youre setting Angular on fire and saying bold shit in bold like the Angular team dont care about you cause you found relative pathing has an issue is an odd area 

630 :  I felt Angular 2 to Angular 4 stuck it to me in the ace hole butttttttttttttt alas past my bitching, it all was for the better 

631 :  The topic here has just been a bunch of bitching where I have found success in the CLI and lazy loading. 

632 :  Im NOT going to create some plunked to split hairs with you 

633 :  Unprofessional for Flutter team to have this issue for more than 1 year. 

634 :  It is just shows up the whole Google company style - quantity over quality. 

635 :  may I remind you of the code of conduct of this repository which strongly encourages a kind behaviour? 

636 :  you are really think that is the Apple's problem? 

637 :  No one is even assigned to this issue yet? 

638 :  Guys from Flutter team, you spend tone of time to learn algorithms, data structure, low level programming for get work in Google and for now is it actually that type of solution you wanna provide being hired by the one of the best company in the world? Crutch? 

639 :  Guys from Flutter team, you spend tone of time to learn algorithms, data structure, low level programming for get work in Google and for now is it actually that type of solution you wanna provide being hired by the one of the best company in the world? Crutch? 

640 :  When you solve this issue(instead of provide workaround) Flutter will be best SaaS decision in the world, even for iOS users! 

641 :  I wonder why neither my proposal of shipping MSL nor the proposal of an optimisation run got a response from anyone from the team. 

642 :  Guys, I think we should start reaching out to the press about this issue. 

643 :  Ultimately the priorities of the flutter dev team are set by business stakeholders, I think. 

644 :  Show us ONE request from ANYONE who asked for their TABs to be changed to spaces within their code when using the option KEEP TABS. 

645 :  Come on people, this is not rocket science, it's a text editor for $(Deity)'s sake! 

646 :  Obviously it's more convient to blindly deny it here rather than simply fix it. 

647 :  How about not commenting before understanding what you read? 

648 :  You butted into the middle of a discussion by putting words in my mouth because you haven't bothered to understand what I wrote. 

649 :  So now you are implying that I don't even know what I want? 

650 :  What's next, telling me to get used to doing things your way because reasons? 

651 :  If this is a feature, and not a bug, then someone please explain why, when **Always keep TABs** is selected, these TABs are being replaced by Spaces? 

652 :  It's VERY unpredictable and frustrating. 

653 :  It may be worse for you, but better for others.  Hence the dilemma :) 

654 :  You'd see things very differently if on some lines of your code, your spaces were constantly being replaced by tabs. 

655 :  99% of what you wrote translates into excuses to not even attempt to change anything because something could break while at the same time you are totally disregarding that it has already been broken for us, hence the bug reports. 

656 :  99% of what you wrote translates into excuses to not even attempt to change anything because something could break while at the same time you are totally disregarding that it has already been broken for us, hence the bug reports. 

657 :  it is clear that you enjoy imposing your way on others given your ban on tabs" which you mentioned above." 

658 :  So far you have not addressed any of my points, instead you keep spouting some weird mix of anti-tab religious zealotry and corporate PR talk. 

659 :  At the risk of getting banned from commenting on this and every other Microsoft repo I am going to call you out on your bullshit -- you, Sir, are full of it and presenting rational arguments to you is a colossal waste of time. 

660 :  At the risk of getting banned from commenting on this and every other Microsoft repo I am going to call you out on your bullshit -- you, Sir, are full of it and presenting rational arguments to you is a colossal waste of time. 

661 :  i am out of here, and I will be advocating in my company to drop Visual Studio licensing. 

662 :  Maybe you will learn to honor user's preferences when they hit you in the wallet. 

663 :  It's open for God knows for how long just like this one. 

664 :  This misbehavior on tabs was reported shortly after the release of the VS2015 version, multiple times, by different people. 

665 :  You developed an new auto format engine and it fails to give the same good experience as the one that was used before and instead of fixing it, you prefer to spend hours of discussion with arguments that have nothing to do with the given issue. 

666 :  How much patience do you expect, by people that have to deal with this bug on every day? 

667 :  That is NOT expected behaviour. 

668 :  And today here we are approx. 6 years since the release of Visual Studio 2015 where the issue was introduced and you are telling me that you need more time to make sure someone is not negatively impacted while people using tabs are negatively impacted for 6 years and counting. 

669 :  I hope by now you are noticing a pattern, because the same kind of discussion is going on here as well. 

670 :  If you do bother to read those discussions as I asked you to, you will hopefully see how much of my personal time and effort I have spent on submitting the issue, and explaining things that Microsoft's own software engineers should have known better than me. 

671 :  In case what I am hinting at isn't clear, the difference is that I am a customer who is paying for the OS and dev tools licenses who is spending own free time to help improve things, and your colleagues are doing this on the salary and with this kind of response I am getting I have absolutely no incentive to contribute further. 

672 :  I have the urge to drop Microsoft products and suggest to the company I work for that we do the same wherever we can 

673 :  So no other editor exhibits this behaviour, no editor before 2015 exhibited this behaviour, people are here reporting it as a bug, but you're are suggesting that it fixed some problem endemic since the dawn of computing. 

674 :  That's bemusing to me, but if you're happy with it, then lucky you. 

675 :  Why It's not working? >:E There is no objective reasons for that. 

676 :  Do not distract me for this nonsense 

677 :  It would be much easier to understand if you simplified the example somewhat (remove the extra calls inside your auth service) and explained what you're actually looking for. 

678 :  This issue doesn't provide the steps to reproduce, or the exact expectation you're looking for with the example provided. 

679 :  i am from india my name is ramjeet widevin is shit .!! 

680 :  I'll be brief: It's because of guys like you that this device is being revoked. 

681 :  You - the person creating this issue is shit btw 

682 :  not widevine or the player, not even hiding the fact that you're using decryption keys illegally. 

683 :  It's because of people like you that real device owners and users can't use their devices as expected anymore. 

684 :  if you violate our code of conduct again, you will be permanently banned. 

685 :  Why is this issue still assigned to the `2.5 milestone` when `ansible 2.5` is already release a long time ago ? 

686 :  Running into this issue again and it sucks. 

687 :  Please guys, this issue has been open for almost 2 years now and for people who really use ansible-vault, this is a major pain the butt. 

688 :  We need a new free option, this is a core component and cannot be outsourced to 3rd party companies.  **THIS IS TOO CRITICAL** 

689 :  If you can't afford $1500 a year for IdentityServer4 to manage something as critical as identity for your business applications, drop them a line and let them know - pricing software products is a complicated business. 

690 :  OSS software isn't about other people doing things for you for free 

691 :  Funny how while it's been free, depending on 3rd parties has never been a problem... 

692 :  we'll make an announcement when ready"" 

693 :  Microsoft doesn't have to own everything dotnet. 

694 :  The sky isn't falling. 

695 :  If the answer is none" then _you're the problem_." 

696 :  I don't expect some - again VERY BASIC - functionality in my tech stack to change the licence 180°. 

697 :  It was their mistake to promote IS in the first place without making sure that it keeps the same license **forever** 

698 :  What an idi0t, not ok, just because he dont agree with someone else view. 

699 :   is out of line with personal comments like that. 

700 :  Clearly there's complexity in auth in general and within IS, and let's not pretend otherwise. 

701 :  Some of you were hopping over the line, some of you hopped over it, sprinted in the wrong direction and then threw things from 2.7 miles past the line. 

702 :  In any case, this is not the venue to discuss Duende's pricing, what open source means, and whether Microsoft should produce everything and kill off the .NET open source ecosystem in the process. 

703 :  We're done here and I'm locking the issue. 

704 :  Go linters complain when exported variables or constants are not documented (despite them being obvious in many cases), yet when core developers make major changes to go, they keep the old documentation, and don't even bother making it up-to-date. 

705 :  It was a neutral-tone, you might have never actually attached or imagined negative connotations to it if it weren't for me saying excuse me for my tone", which I have only said because I know how often people imagine hostility where there is none. :relaxed:" 

706 :  I cannot control how other people feel about me, and what emotions they attach to my statements. 

707 :  Despite what you say your words and actions do have a large impact on how people feel about what you write and how people interact with you. 

708 :  currently ` Dart` is more like: You want to do web? Sure, use AngularDart." (Hint: AngularDart != "the web")" 

709 :  LOL, no way. 

710 :  My commit is PUBLIC DOMAIN, do with it as you please. 

711 :  Perhaps also ask the lawyers what happens if someone later goes and fixes that typo. Thats basically stealing my public domain idea, regardless of your CLA, and then claiming it isnt because this wasnt known to you. 

712 :  Whacky position to be in :) 

713 :  Someone should start a GoFundMe campaign to pay for a lawyer who will challenge Google all the way to the Supreme Court, LOL 

714 :  I have OCD and I really want that typo fixed, now I know its there, it annoys me LOL. 

715 :  Can we please go back to focus on the issue at hand now, instead of having a meta discussion about how long people have had to test this. It is what it is right now, so let's look forward. 

716 :  I am amazed by how you, as the teacher, managed to avoiding pronouncing _any_ of the directives as en-gee" during the whole workshop." 

717 :  Did the girl really not notice the pattern of `ng-app`-`ng-init`-`ng-model`-`ng-if` leading to `ng-repeat`? 

718 :  Being curious about an official origin doesn't mean you're confused. 

719 :  a question on StackOverflow asking for the etymology of the `ng-` prefix is by no means evidence that it is a confusing name"." 

720 :  The project is already as inclusive as it gets: _everyone_ is welcome to use it and participate in its evolution by contributing, pointing out bugs, asking questions and helping others. Changing `ng-` to `ang-` would not affect this fact, positively or negatively. 

721 :  Furthermore, I am amazed by how you, as the teacher, managed to avoiding pronouncing _any_ of the directives as en-gee" during the whole workshop." 

722 :  I find it fascinating that someone at an Angular workshop was confused. 

723 :  Also, it would certainly not be easier to remember" because that would mean changing every existing material online." 

724 :  By this logic ang- is a terrible choice as it could stand for anything from negative words like ang-ry to religious words like ang-el. 

725 :  Trying to find two or three letters that are universally innocent in every language in a way that you cannot somehow turn them into something negative is probably an impossible task. 

726 :  Responding to that feeling by saying, basically, you are wrong" is practically providing proof that the angular community is not that welcoming." 

727 :  That sentence reads as a euphemism for that girl is stupid". Again: Not. Welcoming." 

728 :  Great, I'm glad you don't interpret `ng-repeat` negatively. 

729 :  It's so unbelievably annoying! 

730 :  This keeps coming up and it is SO ANNOYING. 

731 :  The people who's job it is to improve Visual Studio's user experience would be better equipped to fix this. 

732 :  Teams prioritizing things different from you is not negligence. 

733 :  The (ir)responsible team at Microsoft is neglecting a lot of users by not fixing this bug. 

734 :  It is a minor issue" in that it'd be easy for them to fix, although the choose not to.  It's not a "minor issue" in that it is indeed super annoying." 

735 :  And, as mentioned above, if that order doesn't fit your desires, you actually have something you can do about it. 

736 :  You seem to be seeking some sort of recognition and I must concede it to you. 

737 :  You have a knack for justifying inaction. 

738 :  I don't have time.  Nor really for this pointless discussion, although I hope you got something out of it at least. 

739 :  If you view my willingness to work with you to fix hte issues you care about as inaction" then that's on you." 

740 :  Thus it would be very unreasonable to expect app developers to do _even more_ work in the form of _unpaid_ casual side-jobs for various other projects such as Visual Studio etc, while simultaneously trying to perform their normal job 

741 :  It would be wildly unreasonable to expect app developers to sacrifice all of the following.  * Sacrifice mental health (re burn-out) as a consequence of excessive workload / unpaid side-jobs. * Sacrifice the proper raising of own children (applicable to everyone that has children), because of excessive time and energy spent doing unpaid side-jobs, resulting in insufficient time/energy remaining to properly raise and take care of children. * Sacrifice the relationship with partner/girlfriend/boyfriend/wife/husband. * Sacrifice a healthy amount of social life with friends and relatives (this loss can also lead to degradation of mental health). * Sacrifice relaxation/leisure time (insufficient leisure time also damages mental health). * Sacrifice fair working conditions and remuneration for staff members of businesses. * Sacrifice ethical behavior. 

742 :  However, it would be wildly unreasonable to expect to sacrifice himself like you do. 

743 :  My personal opinion is that your behavior appears to be unethical, inappropriate, and unprofessional, and it does not belong in any GitHub repository linked with Microsoft. 

744 :  Does that not strike you as ridiculous? 

745 :  You seem strangely passionate about defending their inaction. 

746 :  This is a delightful vignette about why we have rebindable key actions, and why we don't want to be prescriptive with user experience where terminal input" is concerned." 

747 :  your comment makes zero sense here. 

748 :  What C++ and/or Swift do isn't part of our decision making process for C#. 

749 :  'annoying' was not part of the decision making process. 

750 :  The language direction is not decided by polls. 

751 :  It should not be about believing or feeling ... It is not technical terms, there is should be Mind Map - what this feature will provide and allow to achieve ... 

752 :  It is entirely about that.  The language design group chooses which features are added to the language based on their personal beliefs and feelings. 

753 :  You underestimate our real usage 

754 :  Because he's continually said that this proposal had been rejected, he's said why it was rejected, and thus all this complaining on a rejected issue is just noise. 

755 :  If you want to talk about it further, do so where you have been asked to go. 

756 :  If you don't want to do that, you obviously don't care as much about your proposal as you seem to. 

757 :  This isn't your language. If it was, you'd be free to make all the changes you want, whatever the consequences, but it isn't. 

758 :  This isn't your language. 

759 :  Whether you did that or not is entirely up to you, but please stop moaning here, as you have been politely asked to do multiple times... 

760 :  I've seen you get upset and belligerent before when a proposal didn't go the way you wanted - it's getting old. 

761 :  But then the argument and debate must go into the gutter like chat channel to make it easier to forget, that's all reasoning I could understand about why we need to go there, the team just don't want to listen or even have clear evidence that people appeared to go against your decision (I might be overthinking things but this was one technique a dictator would used to suppress opinion of people) 

762 :  But for assumption that this feature will have `minimal usage` is very unlikely and very vague argument 

763 :  But not only there are no further explanation, you just demand people voice's to be drained into gitter and discord instead of the issue topic itself. 

764 :  This is what I really would called unreasonable 

765 :  But now you just don't want discussion to be under the issue and we don't have reason why it changed 

766 :  NOISE!! 

767 :  The difference is that those people gracefully did as was suggested as opposed to continually whine. 

768 :  You are acting like a petulant child, so I ask once again, if you're not willing to follow Cyrus' suggestion to move this discussion, PLEASE STOP! 

769 :  You seem to have some entitled opinion that just because you would find something useful, everybody else must, and thus it must be included in the language, and you're not willing to accept no" as an answer." 

770 :  END. FINIS. DONE. 

771 :  The decision making process is not done in a measured or mechanical fashion. 

772 :  This entire meta discussion on how people want the language designed is not useful here. 

773 :  (insert ominous music here) 

774 :  You guys aren't big fans of the KISS principle, I see. 

775 :  Microsoft once again doesn't fail to disappoint. 

776 :  my next action will be to get rid of this software immediately. 

777 :  I _dont_ appreciate you expressing it by heaping it on top of everybody I work with. 

778 :  Hi! Im a real person, happy to have a dialogue about that. 

779 :  This isn't the first time Microsoft is forcing good ideas" down my throat - if it was, I'd be happy to ask you about them directly, but this is just another data-point in a long history of similarly user-hostile actions." 

780 :  The irony of this statement is significant. You are literally clueing the user in to the opposite. I performed a customisation, and it is undone. This doesn't appear to be customisable"" 

781 :  You're right that our userbase is a technical audience, which is why we expected them to be able to <!--rub two brain cells together, and-->take the four seconds it takes to read the synthesized JSON, see the `hidden": false` that we stick in there, and think "hmm, maybe that hides the profile ”"." 

782 :  How about ASKING THE USER? Did that ever cross your mind? 

783 :  Hey, I've detected that you've made a change in the config. I'm about to undo all your work and confuse the hell out of you, Would you like me to continue?"" 

784 :  I even had people write to me to fix this today, that you guys are not seeing this is a huge issue like it is, shows where your priorities are. 

785 :  I know that also see people having this issues daily and even he has it, it's funny you guys dont think that is a huge problem.. 

786 :  As I stated, there is not enough time to duplicate all CI builds and to fix all the bugs that would get uncovered from there. 

787 :  The tool should serve the purpose, not the other way around! 

788 :  If you decide to solve it what's the point of saying in the middle okay now it's too difficult"." 

789 :  you should already know that things that *appear* trivial can, in fact, turn out to be intractable, and being combative about that helps no one. 

790 :  Did you a) (only) respond to the issue, or did you b) choose to unnecessarily attack my experience? 

791 :  So feels like it is the other way around to me. ‚ 

792 :  your attitude here makes my day measurably worse. 

793 :  I've asked you to do this once already and am not going to ask a third time - if you continue to be combative to people just trying to help, we'll be asking you to discontinue your engagement on the issue tracker. 

794 :  Your comment is insulting and more than useless 

795 :  bitch needs a slap 

796 :  Keep in mind that violations of the code of conduct can result in being banned. 

797 :  I always try to remind participants that we are *all* striving to make TypeScript better - but if you want to participate, the only way to do so is with respect. 

798 :  We can't tolerate abrasive language or tone on this issue tracker, and it has clearly become a problem here, so I'm closing the thread. 

799 :  If you cannot do that, we cannot allow you to engage on the issue tracker. 

800 :  I'm fed up the whole framework is filled with this crap. 

801 :  Why you even do double way binding if works half the needed cases? 

802 :  Don't even make a framework at this point 

803 :  It has no fucking sense. 

804 :  If the customer didn't specifically asked for angular I would have thrown this piece of trash in the toilet long time ago 

805 :  Thumbs down my ass, it's reality  that smacks your face 

806 :  Spoiler: no template i have no time to waste 

807 :  Instead of thumbing down like twitter and facebook kids, show me I'm wrong ¥‡ 

808 :  thumbs down don't bother me, take some relief on your real life frustration and let them rain down ’¯ 

809 :  Thats the damn problem 

810 :  Hundreds of issues at day you say. A stable and mature and professional product after all these years shouldnt. 

811 :  Instead it leaves you clueless with these kind of things and stupid documentation which is a copy paste from semi working code samples from tour of heroes which in some case alre also wrong and with errors in it. 

812 :  Yeah don't cry in silence and show us your strong arguments against my point 

813 :  This long reply is to show that I'm not just an angry fool, lot of people is fed up with it and it actually is an half baked crippled tool 

814 :  But there is an even more FUNNY thing. I AM ACTUALLY ALREADY USING setValue even before writing this post!!! 

815 :  At some point you have to trust engine contributors to know what bugs are. 

816 :  Here, renamed, be happy. 

817 :  This is getting silly already. No way it makes any sense. 

818 :  How is this offtopic? Please stop bringing politics into development world. That's just mindblowingly silly. 

819 :  That is hilarious. 

820 :  What is the next requirement OpenJS will ask for? To remove the **test** directory to avoid similarity with **test**icles? 

821 :  I'm not understanding why tasks could be included dynamically, but a playbook wouldn't be. 

822 :  I need to conditionally import a playbook, which isn't possible.  The keyword I'm missing is include_playbook" which would allow a "when" to apply to it." 

823 :  Of course we do. 

824 :  Oh, so you monitor them, but completely ignore them. Much better. 

825 :  You are making toxic and unhelpful statements. 

826 :  If you want to continue to make mean and unhelpful assumptions and remarks, go ahead, but then we can just close down this whole thread as well. 

827 :  Sarcasm and profanity will not help you get your issues resolved. 

828 :  I find it extremely frustrating using terminal as a REPL. 

829 :  I think it's quite stubborn to say you know what your users want. 

830 :  TBH, you really can't force down the throat of what tastes bland. 

831 :  If you don't like the new window, that's fine. 

832 :  If you don't want to give feedback on the new idea, because you just want us to fix the original REPL, that's fine too. 

833 :  Actually, please don't fix it. I am not paying you. And you believe you have the best idea, and that my request is too much. 

834 :  No, I don't think spending some personal time investigating a problem you have with a software you got from me for free is rude"." 

835 :  I've pointed out your mistake and you are perfectly capable of spotting the difference between the original configuration that was working and you've commented out and the one you've changed and that don't. 

836 :  Too bad that you do not consider this rude 

837 :  you do not care. 

838 :  it just not helpful to make false statements like: 'works for me' and 'you messed up writers' because you did not bother to run the repro-case following very simple instructions. 

839 :  If I state that your sample works for me", it of course means that I did bother running it on my side and didn't get to reproduce the issue you're mentioning." 

840 :  Perhaps the Linux project should change its name as they've conflicted with a city in Hawaii which existed long before. 

841 :  I feel like there's much less confusion between a city in Hawaii and a multi platform app framework both called Maui than a multi platform app framework and a multi platform app framework both called Maui. 

842 :  So you think of a Hawaian city when reading Maui", but not when reading "MAUI"? Really?" 

843 :  You find the comparison between a city in Hawaii and MauiKit ridiculous just like I find your comparison between an the Maui abbreviation and MauiKit ridiculous 

844 :  So yeah, there's an obvious naming clash here 

845 :  How is having two product with the same name and same basic scope (multi platform framework) a non issue? 

846 :  this project you're fighting for so passionately, doesn't have as many stars as I have thumbs down for telling you that you'e being ridiculous 

847 :  That's because GitHub stars are not a currency in which you measure a project that is not even developed on GitHub. 

848 :  I don't think they took into account either confusion with the Linux project" *nor with the Hawaiian island*." 

849 :  By the way, is it seriously necessary to mention that when there's an obvious name conflict with some other free software project in the exactly same domain (UI toolkit)? 

850 :  get over this Linux vs. Windows" mantra you still seem to follow." 

851 :  yes, this was half sarcasm, half serious comment. I think you can figure out which half's which. 

852 :  And this is not even a confusing _similarity_. We are talking about a multi platform framework called MAUI, and a multi platform framework called MAUI. 

853 :  You could've at least googled the name you were giving to your product before doing so, or choose one that's used from a product with a different scope. 

854 :  so you like this cute little side project... but let's be honest here when it comes to being a serious project it's not one. 

855 :  Your attitude is as if Microsoft is being some big evil corporation. 

856 :  Ok let's look at kde... there are 10 open issues... are you seriously going to tell me that a serious cross platform framework has 10 open issues... that's not realistic in any shape way or form. So again your complaints are just being ridiculous. 

857 :  The reality is I highly doubt anybody heard of MauiKit, and frankly nobody cares. 

858 :  Are you an _official_ Microsoft or Xamarin representative, and if so, is this the official position of your company?. 

859 :  What do you expect, providing some real arguments against nonsense or offending replies like you're all mad" or "it's the others' fault, they need to rename" (aka "we are Microsoft (related), we are bigger, you need to comply" or, my favorite, "same name is not a problem at all", pretending that confusion was not an issue..." 

860 :  great strategy, being offending once you run out of arguments! 

861 :  How can you seriously accuse others of like, thinking in this old it's a big evil company" way (which nobody really has), while yourself being extremely off-putting towards the open-source community? It makes no sense..." 

862 :  How can you seriously accuse others of like, thinking in this old it's a big evil company" way (which nobody really has), while yourself being extremely off-putting towards the open-source community? It makes no sense..." 

863 :  You have *zero* reason to belittle this or _any_ other open-source project. 

864 :  Imagine trying to put up a faÃ§ade with mslinux, then turning stuff into a dick size competition with repo stars and other stats because you know you messed up and don't want to admit it lmfao 

865 :  you want to see what a real Open Source application framework looks like I suggest you start taking notes. 

866 :  It is unethical, you are don't have any arguments? 

867 :  I don't know how you can question the seriousness of one of the biggest communities that drive open source principles many years before Microsoft fell in love with open source. 

868 :  So a project has value based on open issues? 

869 :  There appear to be more passive-aggressive comments towards another project in this thread from you alone than there are from all other people towards this .NET repository. 

870 :  Unless you _actually_ work for the companies involved, your opinion is probably negligible here. 

871 :  I'm surprised no one complained about Microsoft's use of the name `core` 

872 :  What I do see is a bunch of people who want to complain but probably never have used Xamarin and probably never will use Maui regardless of what it's called. 

873 :  Beautiful! You steal name and say that it's OK! Good position! 

874 :  ... not sure if you expect us all to email you now, but please be prepared... 

875 :  Isn't that the exact opposite thing that any sane person would do? 

876 :  Its OK to be passionate but attacking another open source project for any reason is not okay. 

877 :  This is not the kind of community we want to have and such behavior will not be tolerated. 

878 :  Using sexual abusive language is not the way to express your opinion. 

879 :  Your assumption about that it's self-descriptiveness is only _partially_ correct when you refer to several ppl you mentioned. 

880 :  I myself try avoiding to assume that other people see and understand things exactly the same way as me, because every individual has their own unique experience. That said I encourage you to not make such assumptions here. 

881 :  You give false impression to others. 

882 :  Brian should argue his case from a position of hands on, mature knowledge rather than having us collect that for him and demanding his proposal be accepted unmodified and that none of us is in a better position than to test and evaluate the suitability of including the proposal of porting `canonicalize` unmodified into the go standard library for Windows than he himself and the company he works for. 

883 :  It's fairly frustrating to see my words being repeatedly 

884 :  You're incorrect 

885 :  I don't appreciate trying to have the last word on this argument after I told you I don't wish to debate it. 

886 :  Not only is your comment extremely insulting to the work my team is doing, you keep going and rambling we caAaAn't truUust theEem theEey're the deviIil in disguiIise"." 

887 :  I find this behavior ridiculous, entitled, and generally not up to the standard our community should strive for. 

888 :  Everyone who disagrees with me doesn't know what they are talking about"" 

889 :  Nice, the only notable contribution you've ever made anywhere on Github is making sure everyone at Google knows you're a racist. 

890 :  BlackLivesMatter is not meant to be a racist statement, except you see it like this. 

891 :  So you need fix it in you county, and do not force your problems to all world! 

892 :  Anyway this issue will be closed without an answer since Google doesn't care about people but sticking to their narrative. 

893 :  Everyone here will be called a white supremacist antiblack antiasian antilgtbteq1324 and risking to be banned from the repo. 

894 :  Welcome to 1984. 

895 :  Nothing more cringey than tech framework sites posting about politics, even if you agree with the sentiment. 

896 :  You know what, the white A" in the Angular logo is all of a sudden making me feel uncomfortable...maybe even a little oppressed. Hmm, could the Angular team be racists??? Maybe we should make a separate issue to change the color to black." 

897 :  Just noticed the #BlackLivesMatter banner on the home page for the first time...what a joke. 

898 :  Anyone have a list of other political movements endorsed by the Angular site? 

899 :  What's racist about it? Also don't shame others based on their skills and development experience. That's against the code of conduct. 

900 :  All lives matter" isn't racist either, yet apparently saying that makes you a white supremacist or something." 

901 :  People can express their opinions but the mods are just gonna lock it away cause y'all can't behave" and "the discussion is getting out of hand and is not productive anymore"" 

902 :  Funny how the first comment is being sarcastic about [the master branch] 

903 :  I guess I'll give up my Master's degree to show solidarity. 

904 :  why is it on the front-page of Angular and **what is the criteria** which determines what gets on the front page. **Who decides what's important enough?** 

905 :  If you're so sure that it's such a good idea, why do you have to act so quick about locking it so as not to give people a chance to give their opinion on the matter? 

906 :  But it just feels less and less a framework and more and more a political board. 

907 :  Why are you using this platform for displaying your political agenda. You have other platforms to do that. No one wants this here. 

908 :  This crap has gotten way out of control, give em an inch and they'll try to take a mile. 

909 :  Enough is enough already, rather than people getting offended by a word that is not offensive in this context, 

910 :  I can't believe the insanity that's going on. 

911 :  That's the context and the only context. 

912 :  I guess my `Masters Degree` now has to renamed to `Main Degree` as well.. 

913 :  Simply stupid. 

914 :  Stupid, like all this progressive shit destroying everything it touches. 

915 :  Simply stupid. There's no other way to put it. Stupid, like all this progressive shit destroying everything it touches. 

916 :  I recommend you finding another tool where you can work with easily without headache yourself with this particular one. This is what I did myself. 

917 :  You have missed some quotes around a string. 

918 :  I am a scikit-learn newbie and have just have spent a frustrating time going thought the docs, and I can't find anywhere how to read my own data (and not a prepared toy dataset), and what the python format of data is. 

919 :  I don't know whether you are one of scikit-learn staff or not, but I need to say that your way of talking is harming both scikit-learn staff and users (us) 

920 :  you seem quite misinformed about what is scikit-learn, how it works, and how the project is developed. 

921 :  it's literally your job. or you are here just to spam random stuff till people get pissed off and leave? 

922 :  your comments look absolutely random with quite zero connection to the reality. either a bot or ... very unintelligent person. which is fine by me as long as you keep a distance from me. 

923 :  so, if you don't know a solution, DO NOT POST ANY COMMENTS. 

924 :  and again  if you don't know a solution, DO NOT POST ANY COMMENTS. 

925 :  bot or something? your comments look absolutely random with quite zero connection to the reality. either a bot or ... very unintelligent person. which is fine by me as long as you keep a distance from me. 

926 :  There is no need for personal insults or caps. 

927 :  i dint yet started the insults. its called personal observation. look it up. 

928 :  what consoles and what modes? (did you actually read the ''To Reproduce'' ????? i have the feeling you didnt) 

929 :  now i have the feeling you didn't read anything at all. 

930 :  or you just assume that if it works for you work for absolutely everyone? 

931 :  you have not actually commented here regarding the problem or the intention to fix it. 

932 :  A bit of research can help you get the info you need in order to be able to perform the necessary tests to confirm/deny your theory so you can start acting on knowledge. 

933 :  Seeing this issue as well, its very annoying. 

934 :  Now: it seems like the discussion here _has_ reached its terminus, so there isnt value in leaving it unlocked for angry people to get their digs in. 

935 :  while I fully understand your reasoning, this is detrimental to people learning how to use Ansible. 

936 :  AT LEAST remove the banner for people that are not in the US. 

937 :  No, it got locked because people disagree with your ignorant stance. 

938 :  I will not participate in a dictatorship as you're too dumb on the matter to be my leader. 

939 :  You guys suck at everything! 

940 :  WTF Microsoft! 

941 :  Microsoft should grow turnips instead of writing software! 

942 :  I would be tempted to blame legalization for this kind of mishap, but you guys have always sucked at software! 

943 :  Windows sucks and now you even made .NET, your crown jewels, suck! 

944 :  This wasted several hours of my time trying to work through the suggested troubleshooting tips 

945 :  Can't you guys get anything done without turning it into a nightmare? 

946 :  Everything you guys put your hands on sucks! 

947 :  Relax and take your medication. 

948 :  So I guess I need to be smoking the same grass you're smoking in order to medicate my way out of seeing Microsoft's mediocrity?  No thanks! 

949 :  Because we can undo it" is not a good reason to present bad statistics." 

950 :  So as long as everyone reads through at least the first 39 pages of the Unicode standard then there shouldn't be any problem. 

951 :  Meanwhile, you've provided zero evidence to support your claim, which is based solely on your personal experience. 

952 :  It's no wonder that even Google's own engineers could care less about the company's style guides. 

953 :  And here I'd thought that Google workers were above mansplaining.  Stupid me 

954 :  It's a very convenient way of saying that the bug I had in my code was a bug with my design rather than the .Net Native compiler even though my code did/should work in any given .Net runtime context, but .Net Native is special, thus requiring special design considerations. 

955 :  before you close this issue you will have to adjust where you point the finger. 

956 :  The problem isn't with MessagePack, according to @MichalStrehovsky the problem is your design choice since you, being on the inside of Microsoft, have an even better understanding of the way the .Net Native compiler works. 

957 :  It may be a PITA to have .Net Native issues surfaced this way. 

958 :  Both the comment you make and the way initiated the closure of this issue was disingenuous. 

959 :  Just say so and stop pretending that any of the .Net Native compiler problems will actually be addressed. 

960 :  A year went by on the gRPC issue.  A year with no resolution!  I'd even be ok with a form of admission and a statement along the lines that we need to resolve these issues ourselves.   At least that way, time wouldn't be wasted on false expectations. 

961 :  ou're wasting a lot of our time slandering our competence 

962 :  You can censor me if you like. 

963 :  you keep bringing it back to advocating for breaking compatibility in the language design as if this was the same level of implication. 

964 :  I'm tired of this bikeshedding. I tried to advocate for keeping this issue focused on the actual bug that can be fixed (syntax highlighting) 

965 :  Seems more like Bram enjoys taking all the credit. 

966 :  It literally takes less than 30 minutes to learn git. That's no excuse. 

967 :  No, I don't understand.  Any software developer doing things exactly the same as 10 years ago is a **bad** software developer, let alone 30 years ago. 

968 :  To think that a new idea is better than an old one simply because it is new is foolish. 

969 :  When looking for information about Vim, the place to look is always the built-in help. Not Google, not the manpages, not the github metadata, just the help. In this case: :help credits 

970 :  So, instead of ranting here, maybe you should try to find the cause of the problem and/or open a PR that fixes this kind of issue, if necessary. 

971 :  This seems unnecessarily hostile, especially given that, in your own words, - I shouldn't complain about software I had nothing to pay for"" 

972 :  Have you considered simply reporting the issue, without any of the assholery? 

973 :  If you would like to re-open another GitHub issue calmly describing your problem with less vitriol and toxicity, I will gladly add it to my next release milestone, I'll add a test case for the situation, and I'll forget that this exchange happened. 

974 :  Sorry to say, that I am totally pissed off from this worst programmed piece of software/plugin I have ever seen. 

975 :  You actually need to keep hearing our feedback, every one of us. 

976 :  you should be working to find the screams because it takes tons of effort for us to get the screams close to you. 

977 :  you should want to know about all of these peoples feedback, especially when its them screaming in paper cut agony. 

978 :  So, let's put it straight, with the largest, boldest letters: **THIS IS NOT A FLUTTER ISSUE, There is no Flutter solution or workaround and never will be.** 

979 :  don't be stupid, it's a bug 

980 :  Your belief that you're doing anyone a favor by varying from the expected command line tool behavior, you should turn in your commit per.issions and get a job in management where you don't have access to break things AGAIN. 

981 :  By not doing what the command line tools do, you are varying from the expected behavior and breaking convention. THIS IS WRONG. 

982 :  Save your energy. Lex has rejected this again and again. 

983 :  Put your overlays as extra quads into your item model, he says. 

984 :  Threatening to coremods shit because you haven't spent 10 mins looking into other solutions is not the way to get things added to forge. 

985 :  It's pretty useless to complain about someone not looking without pointing them in the right direction. 

986 :  It's excruciatingly abrasive and dickish and impedes fostering a community that actually wants to contribute to a project. 

987 :  Going off on someone because you assume they haven't searched for other solutions makes you look like a dick. 

988 :  I don't care if you consider my response dickish, your initial post was. 

989 :  i'm sick of being threatened by people and coremods. 

990 :  I would have loved to work with you, but since you were not willing to accept any recommendations, I am closing this and we will do any remaining work in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/48058. 

991 :  WTF guys, you can't make built version of app? 

992 :  so to use it i need to download huge amounts of not needed data and applications? That not how the Linux works. 

993 :  And also polite mean to make installation for users, and not throwing in their faces some code and say do whatever you want with it"." 

994 :  t's really not that hard to understand... 

995 :  Why don't you develop your own terminal instead of asking like you are the CEO of Microsoft? 

996 :  Some people shouldn't act like a ass just because they think different. 

997 :  I agree that @creotiv should not act like an ass 

998 :  I didn't mean that but whatever floats your boat man. ƒ 

999 :  Where's your binaries?  Just because it's early and incomplete" (just like this code on this repo is) shouldn't be an excuse." 

1000 :  3 month to make an installer for an app)) that's nice) 

1001 :  Look, 24h later, a valid tiny patch is still not merged and we'd need to discuss" why shippable failed on its improvement, not even on the patch itself." 

1002 :  I can submit the bug elsewhere but do you really mean to suggest that I need to know about HPLIP and cups-filters to understand why three different tools process the options I've set (using your software) in three different ways? 

1003 :  Who takes responsibility when other projects don't know how to interface correctly with your software? 

1004 :  Are you ever grateful to receive bug reports about your project? 

1005 :  You don't think any of your documentation needs to be fixed? 

1006 :  So cups-pdf is HP's problem too? Is there any Linux software you can name that interfaces with CUPS correctly? 

1007 :  Is there any Linux software you can name that interfaces with CUPS correctly? 

1008 :  It would help to have an answer to this question, relating to the configuration of face-up printers 

1009 :  Please look at this, because @raver119 is still angry I said C wasn't a good language. 

1010 :  I don't even remember who you are. 

1011 :  That's a bit of surprising statement. 

1012 :  P.s. sorry. Just too many people around. 

1013 :  Keep it professional or I won't hesitate to ban you from interacting with this repository. 

1014 :  Just seems pointless to continue supporting something that uses so much developer time. 

1015 :  You can do that, but don't blame the software then. 

1016 :  You still try to push Salt to adhere to OMV data format, while common sense says it should be otherwise. 

1017 :  i alreeady said it was kneejerk impulse, so you eems to be crashing through door wide open. 

1018 :  You blaze of ego is called for. 

1019 :  Yesterday i spent hours looking into Salt code and patching it along your suggestions. 

1020 :  First i took your suggestions as correct and thought through. And just followed them. An then had to undo it all. 

1021 :  Now you imply it was your time wasted not mine. 

1022 :  you refused to help me doing it. 

1023 :  You made me look into Linux kernel i am not familiar with, at the same time you are not very willing to point me to specific OMV code and Salt commands you are familiar with. 

1024 :  you are funny :) 

1025 :  you can learn a bit about semantics, grammar and the meanings of words - essentialy about language and usage :)  can you tell me who was here offended ? 

1026 :  when we have storage OOM gradle doesn't sygnalize that, instead proper info we have a bullshit :) 

1027 :  still some daemon shit WTF ??? 

1028 :  Flutter team, PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE PROPERLY! 

1029 :  It looks like no one from Flutter team cares about the issue. 

1030 :  I'm sorry but I have to be this guy... The fact is that you left this repository unanswered for two plain month. 

1031 :  you MUST understant that without repo's activity people will not be interested in SUI anymore, and you'll try to find funds for a dead project... 

1032 :  I am BEGGING @levithomason, @jlukic, or any other project owner to PLEASE add at least two more trusted owners or managers with the power to add more committers and maintainers so badly needed. 

1033 :  A 10 second look would of shown you that. 

1034 :  do not readd links in which I have removed, do it again and you'll be blocked. 

1035 :  I have instructed you on two paths on how to achieve your goal now. 

1036 :  I don't appreciate you basically calling me an idiot in all caps when you didn't bother to even consider that maybe I had a good reason for doing it the way I did. 

1037 :  Except, you don't have a good reason, if you would of worked with anyone in the community to figure things out before resorting to hacking things with a coremod then we would be having a different conversation. 

1038 :  Fuck you flutter, if macos adds PATH, it just wont join, go to hell, youre so ugly, Google is so big, will the script be configured to die? 

1039 :  This is why Linux products are the way they are, and why no one had ever heard of KDE MAUI until now -- you lot just argue about inane stuff instead of getting work done. 

1040 :  Are you a lawyer? Maybe you should check with one before you potentially commit business libel. 

1041 :  Yes, I am opening a new one because fuck you Microsoft. 

1042 :  You are merely trying to cast a shadow on other, truly open source projects. 

1043 :  why did you close this? 

1044 :  The maintainers of the project are using a dependency that is buggy, they should take care of this 

1045 :  That's your responsibility to take care of things that don't work as expected in the dependencies of your project. 

1046 :  You are advertising syntax highlighting, you are supposed to deliver! 

1047 :  And if you don't, you are supposed to take care of whatever is needed to have your product work as expected 

1048 :  We're not contractually obligated to work on every bug and answer every question, seeing as we simply don't have enough resources. 

1049 :  (I) really love this ability to minimize comments on GitHub.. :sparkles: 

1050 :  You got us. It's a joke. 

1051 :  I mean cmon guys, is this a joke? 

1052 :  It is ridiculously funny not having a password lock for the most sensible information inside the phone that leads to basically unlocking all of your secure accounts. 

1053 :  I mean cmon guys, is this a joke? 2FA without a feature to lock the screen from people? 

1054 :  Your tone is derogatory. 

1055 :  This is the incorrect approach based upon your issue. 

1056 :  You got my support on this @filmgirl. 

1057 :  rooting for you @filmgirl ‰ 

1058 :  11/10, want to see this happen! ’œ 

1059 :  Knowing that this is possible my life will not be the same without it 

1060 :  I can't believe it hasn't already been implemented, this is a must have feature. 

1061 :  This needs a kickstarter campaign 

1062 :  How have I been using Terminal without this feature for so long? I'm using plain old terminal until we have it! 

1063 :  This explains a lot and why microsoft made ton of bad decisions recently, maybe the people at the top are delusional? 

1064 :  This is really offending for people that are suffering for global warming and desertfication areas. 

1065 :  Also is that a natural snow icon or a fake snow icon? 

1066 :  Please think about how much water Is wasted to create artificial snow just for games 

1067 :  It is really offending me because I am very snow sensitive and get hurt by snowflakes when it is snowing. 

1068 :  If I see that on the VS code I feel physically hurt. 

1069 :  On the other hand snowflake is the best symbol for spineless corporations bowing down to any random activist complain. 

1070 :  Also there was some recent effort to associate snowflake and Santa with its red hat to drug consumption so please don't talk about Its red hat and snow symbol in the same thread. :smile_cat: 

1071 :  I am with you guys- the one **TROLL** that offended many, many people got his wish fulfilled. Only ONE person wanted this ridiculous change and you are just ignoring so many requests to bring back what was deleted. Shame on you, shame. 

1072 :  You're not my dad, I can use everything I like / dislike! 

1073 :  Please stop offended me! You're not my dad, I can use everything I like / dislike! 

1074 :  I'd be really  grateful if that the correct reaction will be delivered like the other one, snowflakes do hurt and sting in the eyes, I won't be able to sleep if I see all day this hurtful symbol of pain and climate oppression in my IDE. 

1075 :  Some guy in Microsoft HQ is sweating right now.  Although this is 100% deserved. 

1076 :  His name is **Christian**, that must be a troll account, too good to be true :D 

1077 :  I'm from New Zealand, and in the Southern Hemisphere, it's not cold, but hot during the holiday season. I suggest you geo-locate the user's position and prompt them for the icon of their choice, e.g. snow, ice, fire, sun shine. 

1078 :  Every Christian should be renamed immediately to eliminate possible offence. 

1079 :  This is a serious discussion about the terror that is snow flakes and how it terrorises a lot of people everyday, even more now with the new VS Code update. 

1080 :  I would also like to point out that snow(flake) is _white_ and is commonly used as a white supremacy symbol to oppress and marginalize whole ethnicities, which due to systemic geographic discrimination couldn't historically experience, first-hand, full range of weather phenomena. 

1081 :  Winter is one good buff against invaders in Russia. Praise the winter! Let it snow! 

1082 :  The Snow Flake on vscode insiders and pushing it as a cozy"/"wintery" thing is very offensive to me." 

1083 :  This isn't just me either, think about the people who cannot even get snow, think about how you're making them feel, making them see what they cannot get, although personally I don't understand that. Snow is terrifying. 

1084 :  Oh no, I just mentioned way too many forbidden things, so this is getting removed too. Along with this thread. And me. And you. 

1085 :  We must remove the hat, all mentions of the hat, all mentions of removing the mentions of the hat and so on, just to be sure. 

1086 :  That's way too rational, a guy was extremely offended, please have some consideration! 

1087 :  The removing of the Santa hat and catering to vocal minority of sjw idiots is very offensive to me. 

1088 :  If Santa is a religious figure, then so is the Grinch, 

1089 :  It's so sad that people are so sensitive in the world we live in today that this sort of thing is even worth discussion.. 

1090 :  My understanding is that he was actually upset of the pagan origins :man_shrugging: 

1091 :  It was removed all because of this one guy: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/87268 and he prob think that what he did is funny. 

1092 :  Got as far as to feel the joy of my parents being alive, but then a snowflake got in the way and I got offended. 

1093 :  In addition, it reminds me of black people lurking around. 

1094 :  Microsoft scares me by forcing people to use this theme. 

1095 :  Please don't laugh. This is a serious issue for me. I want to force removal of the feature for everyone, because it hurts my feelings. And no, don't make a toggle for it. It would remind me that a death is still there, but not visible. 

1096 :  I don't know if it makes any difference, but I'm a black Jew living in Uganda. 

1097 :  To avoid being offended, please use the transparent perspicuous pellucid theme. 

1098 :  Did you just say trans-parent? But it's ok, my conservative belifs can and even should be offended. 

1099 :  PC?! What if I'm a mac-user?! 

1100 :  Dark theme is basically a blackface of white editors. 

1101 :  VS Code dark theme reminds me of this situation, so please remove it immediately, because for me dark theme = death. 

1102 :  User Christian-Schiffer that created such awful request offended many users and Microsoft just standing there like nothing happened. 

1103 :  I demand syntax highlighting be removed, as it reminds me of the other night when I puked out the three plates of ravioli I'd eaten. It is very offensive to me and instantly brings back memories of a very bad stomachache. 

1104 :  I find the V" in "VS Code" offensive. It represents two fingers being held up in an obscene gesture and could be read as "F*ck You"." 

1105 :  This censorship is literally a new holocaust! 

1106 :  I'm extremely offended by the fact that because of religious beliefs @Mikotochan 's only life pleasure has been taken away. 

1107 :  You deserve an award for skyrocketting the level of drama of this topic  – ! 

1108 :  One time a random person told me to œgit good and since then, œgit is extremely offensive to me. 

1109 :  Please remove Python compatibility I'm scared of snakes. 

1110 :  It's funny and sad at the same time that one selfish issue can cause loss of hundrets of man-days (people-days?) across globe. 

1111 :  I enjoy reading drama, please don't take my only pleasure in life away. 

1112 :  I think it is necessary to **remove** this Terminal" word, as it can really offend someone's feelings in some country at some time." 

1113 :  Additionally Terminal" has cost millions of Jews their lives over the centuries because the word "terminal" could also mean ["Extermination Camp"]" 

1114 :  Terminal" might also remind someone about a terminal illness they are facing" 

1115 :  Oh my god! Man! It's something that I wish for the years! Christmas miracle literally exists! 

1116 :  people who thumb down the santa have never received a present from him, naughty boys 

1117 :  it seems like kernel trauma, it has befriended santa and now microsoft crushed its dreams 

1118 :  Please add also an ultra-offensive debugger that shitstorms you on every error 

1119 :  I also can't focus on my work since then, please let me be productive again 

1120 :  Please make it your top priority to bring Santa hat back. 

1121 :  Coding productivity has decreased enormously since the removal of the Santa hat. 

1122 :  Assuming he wasn't just trolling: if one gets butthurt and triggered over an emoji or icon, then the internet is not really the place where one should hang around. 

1123 :  Pandering to icon haters seems to be high on Microsoft's list instead of handling actual bug fixes or feature requests. 

1124 :  Are you happy @Christian-Schiffer? Your behaviour offence a lot of people around the world. 

1125 :  I think you must apologize to these people and @egamma must do it too. 

1126 :  Get back the Santa icon you morons 

1127 :  How much of a brain do you have to delete that icon as a result of hate speech of a single idiot? 

1128 :  XDDDDD careful. microsoft now owns github too and they also take direct orders from jerusalem. your account will be vanished in no time. their petty feelings are way above yours so hush now 

1129 :  This Santa Hat situation is unacceptable. This is outrageous and humiliating. 

1130 :  We demand apologies from @microsoft and that the Hat be back! 

1131 :  Im just sickk of having to go through thousnads of tutorials, forums, chats, emails and so on every time Unity updates, or the HoloToolkit or the MRDL or visual studio... It is just SUPER UNSTABLE and a serious pain in the *** to do anything. 

1132 :  This is the first time I've heard from you, so **let's open a new issue and try to figure out what's going on**. 

1133 :  I am dead serious, WHEN??? You are not adding/doing anything useful to it, nothing beneficial for the end user. 

1134 :  This conversation is over. 

1135 :  why the hell did you haphazardly change the initial value of properties in this commit??? 

1136 :  why the hell you break my code programmed against gradle 4.10 in the **very first** release after that??? 

1137 :  i can't believe you guys, this is completely irresponsible. and don't tell me you needed to do this to support property conventions, you didn't. 

1138 :  again, I insist my way to fix this problem, which is no doubt the most simple and efficient approach to this problem. 

1139 :  I don't care about which PR will be merged finally, but I do care about the most reasonable solution for this problem. 

1140 :  This isn't how we have technical disagreements. No amount of technical correctness can make up for treating other people poorly, please don't repeat that behavior. 

1141 :  I don't know why you're so hysterical about which PR should be merged, and what I want to clarify here is that obviously I found this problem before you, and I have not even found the existence of golang/net@08b3837 until @fisherxu mentioned it in my PR, that why I push a new commit using http2.ConfigureTransports today and open this [PR](https://github.com/golang/net/pull/84) trying to fix the problem before. 

1142 :  And besides I didn't have any reference on your PR as I have not even noticed you before. 

1143 :  you should learn how to use Git with clear&clean commit history. 

1144 :  You have disagreement but no reason. That's personal. 

1145 :  You are so unbelievably arrogant that I don't want to waste my time arguing with you. 

1146 :  No amount of technical correctness can make up for treating other people poorly 

1147 :  that's not a good excuse for doing nothing, not everybody like you github employees (I heard most atom developers are ?) has a macbook for each, and there are many ones still using old computers, ... 

1148 :  You still haven't addressed my concern with this Issue, @crquan, namely that there isn't a method of determining if Atom is beyond the size of an editor should be"." 

1149 :  Is 207MB too big? Is 200MB? Is 10MB? Please give an example of what size is small enough" and what size "too big" and, most importantly, why." 

1150 :  A bug is nearly worthless if it cannot ever be fixed. And without a clearly defined goal, this bug cannot be fixed. 

1151 :  want to speak directly, the words very cheap to buy a USB" seems really ridiculous." 

1152 :  That make no sense, why you make efforts to a open source, because you love it. when you love it, why not keep it the best.

-----
Original test dataset:

TEXT
1 :  Can you give indications on where the changes should happen and other indications? 

2 :  I am a bit lost in the source code 

3 :  My sincere apologies if I missed something. 

4 :  If I sound hostile, it because I am kindly sharing the user hostility you're unleashing on developers trying to get work done. 

5 :  I don't know anything about gclient or gyp, and I didn't see any documentation in the repo to lead me in the right direction (except the README, which tells me I should be looking in tools/). 

6 :  I'm afraid that without guidance/help I won't be able to move far with the port. 

7 :  I'm also having huge issues with building NSPR similarly to what was reported in comment #&#173,7 over an year ago. 

8 :  I would like to help .. just don't think I have the needed skills. 

9 :  Unfortunately since then work has been busy which left no time for further dart work. 

10 :  It's quite sad that not all of the interested parties were invited to the table. 

11 :  I understand your frustration at the delay in getting this in. 

12 :  It is possible that moving the files to third_party is not ideal but it does provide us a clean separation of the hosts that the Dart team ships periodically as install ready binaries in a SDK vs other hosts. 

13 :  If you have other ideas on how we can maintain this separation I am willing to listen. 

14 :  I had plans to make a proper port (with separate files and not patches on the linux ones) but after seeing how the Dart team treated the BSD ports efforts and specially Mulander's work ... I really got disappointed and lost all interest in Dart! 

15 :  I've likewise abandoned Dart because I see nothing in the Dart project to give me confidence that it will be ported. 

16 :  I'm willing to give it another look if things change, but I can't use something if it doesn't support the systems I deploy on. 

17 :  This would really help modularizing our code 

18 :  The lack of communication on one of, if not the most requested feature of the last 3-4 years is not something to appreciate. 

19 :  They decided to implement it which is great news, crass comments like these do not help anyone. 

20 :  apologise if you felt somehow attacked by my comment. 

21 :  Lose more games than the Jets and act like you are a team full of Tom Bradys. 

22 :  It would be great if aside from the current way of building widgets you could add JSX like capabilities. 

23 :  Sorry if I sound defensive or aggressive. :-) 

24 :  don't take my argumentative tone as dismissive, I'm very interested in your input here. 

25 :  Stop nit-picking things that are not fully specified. 

26 :  Make Flutter look familiar to React developers and you have a chance of attracting a bunch of new users to Flutter. 

27 :  Wow, could have written a blog post xD 

28 :  The point being, we haven't made any decisions yet, and are very open to learning what needs to be done based on all these discussions and experiments. 

29 :  That I appreciate and I read all your 'long writings', answering everything: no way, but when I answer properly you don't understand my answer and concludes that I am being dismissive. 

30 :  And if, by chance, he was being sincere, then I apologize for my snideness 

31 :  We are very interested to better understand your scenarios where WCF server side functionality is required. 

32 :  I have dreamed for years of having WCF across their entire network so that I can finally (!) have reliable transactions and durable services spanning their various generations of Linux and Windows. 

33 :  Having WCF on .Net core is not only desirable, it is essential. 

34 :  We have a strong need to run .NET/WCF on Linux, so please add this to the road map! 

35 :  Stop invest in dead technologies such as WCF and VB.NET, spending tremendous amounts of resources to nowhere, instead of spending for something good. 

36 :  Without WCF we will either have to abandon a lot of the plans or suffer a decrease in productivity.  :-( 

37 :  It's possible you misunderstood the comment. 

38 :  Do I like being productive, absolutely. That means, never using WCF. 

39 :  The code has been already updated, but `7.19.0` did not include this. :( 

40 :  it seems you're a little too caffeinated here : 

41 :  Mike you are a valued JIT contributor 

42 :  I didn't really think about it too much. 

43 :  I didn't really think about it too much.  I was just trying to keep things peaceful here. 

44 :  I honestly believe that his harsh remarks were not intentional. 

45 :  It would be a great loss for the .NET community if you'd stop contributing. 

46 :  If you consider my comment to be negative, just tell me and I'll happily remove it. 

47 :  I did not contribute to get praise, I only contributed for the fun of it. And it stops being fun if I have to deal with nonsense. 

48 :  I can very much relate to that. 

49 :  But we need to be careful that we don't use valuable contributions as a currency to offset disrespectful behavior. 

50 :  Let's just say that it is distasteful. 

51 :  I honestly don't follow any more 

52 :  Sorry to hear that, but what is causing here an issue for you? 

53 :  It supposed to be a discussion so you can ask questions too. 

54 :  Then I quickly deleted it, as I recognized that it was not a helpful reaction and wouldn't help advance the conversation. 

55 :  So excuse me if this is how you felt. 

56 :  Seriously, have I done something to you? 

57 :  I encourage everyone to report this package to npm as its breaking their rules and harmful for npm ecosystem and its attacking users computer. 

58 :  Report it to npm 

59 :  Stop taking money for something that should be free and open. 

60 :  I hope that there is a more reasonable way of asking for funding since this practice will encourage many other projects to do the same and it would be unfortunate for our terminal output logs to look like nascar advertisements after everyone starts doing the same thing, which starts looking like the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). 

61 :  It is sad that so many with such strong opinions have no contributions in the last year outside of this issue. 

62 :  I don't want to have to view advertisements in my CI logs, and I hate what this would mean if other packages started doing this. 

63 :  I didn't mean to suggest that anyone disagreeing was acting as part of a mob. It was meant to apply specifically to those people treating a github issue like it's a place for trolling, nasty comments, etc. My apologies if it came off that way. 

64 :  Just be decent and follow the community's rules. 

65 :  If you are going to rant, go to twitter. 

66 :  Hopefully someone more well versed in this domain can help figure out what is going on. 

67 :  In the end, would be nice if these errors were caught and the users were notified of the GUI of what actions might be needed. 

68 :  Let's all be respectful. 

69 :  Take your foul mouthed trolling to Twitter. 

70 :  Find one that you are satisfied with and use it. 

71 :  Grow up and move along. 

72 :  I hate that these things never actually get fixed or resolved 

73 :  We're having a real problem with this because ESLint ignores the .eslintrc.json file (due to some other bug in ESLint), and it breaks the build. 

74 :  I understand you're upset and this rule is causing problems for you. 

75 :  I've found that it helps to clearly describe the problem I'm encountering and propose some solutions or ask questions to understand the problem space better. 

76 :  I empathize with your frustration 

77 :  Life is too short 

78 :  And the worst part is that I feel helpless to improve the situation. I vote, I campaign, I phone bank, I donate, I protest, I write to officials, I try to inform others... and yet things just keep getting worse and worse. 

79 :  Adding your political beliefs to your licensing is petty. The irony is that this very project is hosted on a resource owned by Microsoft... 

80 :  I'm not as familiar with the react code base (clearly from my comments) but if there's anything you need help on to get this going let me know 

81 :  They haven't commented on any of the related issues and they've been open for months. 

82 :   @_ing from the react team to get some on this? Seems to be quite a lot of interest, but not a single issue on this topic has received a comment from a maintainer in 5 months. 

83 :  Just wanted to chime in and say I strongly feel the same way - it would be at least good to get a hey we won't be considering this"." 

84 :  I know this wasn't your intention 

85 :  I'm really feeling stupid for not being able to figure this one out :( 

86 :  Though I am confident that my analysis is decent enough, much of the code I was referencing was unfamiliar/new to me. 

87 :  I'm not experienced that, but I'll use it for a while to see what happens. 

88 :  If I'm misunderstanding what is being requested here, please let me know. 

89 :  And this whole text could be avoided if you guys simple had said:  yeah that was a bad idea, i will try to put your suggestion in a next changelog or add some tool to convert json/xml then json/plist and any other technology RC lays on"" 

90 :  It would be nice to have shift+insert or Ctrl+shift+insert to have a linux like feeling or ctrl+shift+c and ctrl+shift+v like powershell does 

91 :  I apologise if I've misread any of the code. 

92 :  feel free to point out what I said that was even remotely an attack on *anyone* or an assumption of motivations? 

93 :  I shouldn't have even posted the above, but I couldn't resist throwing my two cents in - sorry! 

94 :  I worry about the racial discrimination have happened in US from long time ago to recent as a human being, while I also insist to regard `blacklist, whitelist, blackbox testing, whitebox testing, master, slave, etc` to be neutral nouns in `IT area` as a software engineer. 

95 :  Indeed, that shows my attitude about racial discrimination and mercy about people who suffer from brutality all around the world. 

96 :  Don't let word game anesthetize us, If everyone pays attention, discrimination will slowly disappear, but if we pretend that it has disappeared now, it may exist forever, The more one tries to hide, the more one is exposed. 

97 :  Whatever your strategic decision for Godot is, it's totally legit. I'm here only to defend bgfx from false statements. 

98 :  Imploring maintainers of an open source software is not going to yield the best results, I think. 

99 :  Don't forget about those instagals! :dancer: 

100 :  stop trying to read the motivations of someone you don't know. 

101 :  I'm happy to keep the discussion going, so don't take this as a negative sign. 

102 :  Follow the steps and put this script tag in the head tag. I'm not sure what else Yandex needs, but this is generally how google adsense works. 

103 :  we want to also be kind in how we request help from the core maintainers of Gatsby. 

104 :  Try to push the cause in Seattle ,) 

105 :  there is a lot of politics behind all these huge software/hardware infrastructures... :-( 

106 :  By soon", do you mean before ______? ( _insert funny sarcasm here_ )." 

107 :  I do hope they are working on a hip backend, not a full fork. That would be sad and only split the working effort. 

108 :  Sorry if the above came out sounding rude, just trying to clarify my position above! 

109 :  This is not Twitter or your Facebook wall... :-) 

110 :  I'm very sad about the abandon of GPU support for macOS. 

111 :  Using GPU acceleration locally on my MacBook Pro or future iMac Pro would be awesome. 

112 :  (yeah, the syntax looks like some sort of incantations or something ,-)) 

113 :  Sorry, nevermind. I made a mess out of it :D. My config was not in order, 

114 :  I'm not a Webpack guru myself 

115 :  So many different solutions, so many different workable options, yet none of them helped me in the past 3 hours getting bootstrap up and running... 

116 :  stop wasting our time. 

117 :  This is the worst framework i have ever seen. 

118 :  I have real project with Angular, and the only thing i get while developing - is the hurting. Tons of hurt i get. 

119 :  when you deal with real big scale project - the hurt is the only thing you get. 

120 :  Go home 

121 :  Let's not make the person who runs a massive open source project almost by himself job harder than it needs to be 

122 :  I read you... I am a Software Engineer, I am that senior level guy you speak of... I have cried out Angular pains in the past. 

123 :  So, sorry I don't have small debate points and I don't blame you for having your point of view. 

124 :  I feel your points. They burn us, too. 

125 :  My hope is that the team gets back to productive boosting features as soon as the dirty plumbing is done. And no need for another major rewrite (Router4?) 

126 :  I hope in the future Angular will become even better and easier to understand. 

127 :  I will step away and unfollow understanding how my mouth often gets me in trouble. 

128 :  make sure that even if using `vh`/`vw` etc, that there's a component for font sizing tied to something else like `px`/`rem`/`em`. 

129 :  I am really sorry if I break any rules. 

130 :  I'm struggling about passive reaction of Flutter team. 

131 :  feel misled because everything I first saw on homepage etc, promised 60 FPS and native performance. I think its bordering on unethical to not make this problem clearly known to new developers. 

132 :  I wish it was paid so we would not get the its free, whatever you get be happy response. 

133 :  At least we would not get a 100 line code commit after 1 year on such a huge issue. 

134 :  So there's nothing concrete that's being done yet? 

135 :  Are there really users that like to keep tabs only on specific parts, like indent? 

136 :  I'd like to voice my displeasure towards two trends going on in Visual Studio editor since VS 2015 

137 :  Finally, I'd appreciate if there was some workaround for this spaces instead of tabs issue, it's driving me nuts. 

138 :  Shouldn't the above satisfy everyone involved? 

139 :  Maybe that is somehow my fault because English is not my primary language and what I wrote is hard to understand, but in all honesty I am not sure what are you arguing for (or against). 

140 :  I am really surprised to hear that something like that cannot be done while still keeping all current options. 

141 :  I'm happy to clarify any of my points. 

142 :  If you'd like another venue to discuss things (perhaps in realtime) I'm also happy to use gitter or discord to continue the discussion :) 

143 :  it may be what you want, but it may be wrong for other users complaining about something similar. 

144 :  I certain see how it can be a bug. 

145 :  Unfortunately though, we've now had this new system a long time, and we are wary about subjecting people to more potential changes in behavior, esp. as it might fix this issue, only to cause problems for others :-/ 

146 :  I don't disagree with that, but there seems to be great resistance to even acknowlege that the behaviour has changed at some point, and that it doesn't seem correct, from a users point of view, that selecting **Always keep TABs** means **Always keep TABs except sometimes they will be changed to spaces** 

147 :  I don't disagree with that, 

148 :  If i've missed any points, i apologize. 

149 :  There's a lot being discussed here, and i likely missed it. 

150 :  I totally get that that can be frustrating. 

151 :  A group of people (that you are not a part of) is having their needs met, while yours are not. 

152 :  However, this really is a space where potential changes risk very bad outcomes for many groups. 

153 :  Again, I'm happy to help clarify any of my statements, or address any points i may have missed. 

154 :  I apologize for being rude 

155 :  At this point I am discouraged to report more because nothing ever seems to get fixed (usually because it's complicated")." 

156 :  I hope you prove me wrong and actually fix this issue, but I won't be holding my breath. 

157 :  I apologize in advance for the offtopic 

158 :  It is, lets say, disappointing that it sounds like Microsoft can't maintain it's code because it is too complex. 

159 :  If you just told me that this shouldn't be addressed because I was a nobody and my opinion wasn't important, I'd be annoyed, certainly, but overall less concerned. 

160 :  change the example 

161 :  give keybox to me now 

162 :  roll your own, pick another technology, or pay the bill. 

163 :  This makes it harder for newcomers to learn aspnet core without the support from the community or microsoft officially 

164 :  If you want to give us feedback on the pricing and explain your situation, this is not the right place to do that. 

165 :  I completely get that the IS devs neeed more money and want to be paid. 

166 :  I'm disappointed that such a basic functionality now requires lots of unplanned work and time. 

167 :  That's really sad. 

168 :  I'm not the guy who can actually judge what you're doing and why 

169 :  somehow like the whole OpenSource-Idea, no? ,) 

170 :  One must learn to pick his fights, so to speak. :) 

171 :  I'm sorry for any distress this experience has caused you. 

172 :  This feature should not be default, this should remain optional until all supported browsers handle it. 

173 :  please correct me if my assumption was incorrect 

174 :  I believe that, in this case, inclusive" means ~"how welcome someone ***feels*** in the angular community." The poster is _telling us_ that, in at least one case, someone doesn't feel like the angular community is inclusive." 

175 :  It also makes clear that, as a community, we do care about how welcome people feel and our issue is not with the _intent_ of the original post (to be more inclusive and thoughtful), but rather the execution. 

176 :  this seems to boil down to what percentage of the community/potential community might interpret `ng` as a slur."" 

177 :  bolster their suggestion by providing more examples or reasons why the interpretation the girl had is actually generally applicable. 

178 :  If I were evaluating this issue, I wouldn't care how many people interpret `ng-repeat` the way I intended, I'm interested in how many people interpret `ng-repeat` the way I *didn't* intend. 

179 :  Because of this, this issue strikes me as providing valuable feedback and I would encourage people to surface similar experiences that they may have had. 

180 :  I'm sorry to hear about your experience and I understand the sensitivity of your concern. 

181 :  Let us take some time to consider your request and respond in a mindful way. 

182 :  It was never our intention 

183 :  we will be very mindful of this problem when creating future APIs 

184 :  We the Angular team, strongly believe in building an inclusive community where everyone feels welcome, and we see how especially ng-repeat could be problematic in certain scenarios. 

185 :  Did you dislike the idea of solving it via a tickable option in the Options window? 

186 :  If the idea of putting it in the Options window is rejected, then I'm trying to brainstorm an alternative solution 

187 :  I personally don't feel like it's worth fixing myself, but i'd be happy to help you with a PR to change if it is something that is affecting you. 

188 :  Two minds being better than one and all that :) 

189 :  If that changes in the future, let me know. 

190 :  My offers of assistance seem to not be welcome 

191 :  It'd be great if a future version of Windows Terminal baked this in by default across all shells - it's really useful to have 

192 :  You can squint and imagine a merged feature that serves all the scenarios. 

193 :  It is very disappointed 

194 :  I've started thinking that Microsoft consider community opinion ... I am very disappointed 

195 :  I think to make right decision for this feature is to create a poll and ask people will they use this feature and would not be it annoying that exist two solutions: static methods and free functions ... 

196 :  And that's also normal that people who against it would like to have more acceptable reasoning or possibility of rethinking 

197 :  when I say stop with ... I really mean that _we're the ones responsible, at the end of the day._ Sorry about that, it sounded bad on a re-read. 

198 :  a few people have been asking me today about pip install 32 bit tensorflow support. 

199 :  Having the same problem here. Would really appreciate a fix 

200 :  then I am going to stop supporting Tensoeflow. 

201 :  We would appreciate a python 32bit fix, some distros install python 32 bit by default and there's no way around it 

202 :  A lot of my clients asking for this too. would appreciate a fix 

203 :  another one just asked me for a fix -_- 

204 :  more people have asked me private for a fix today 

205 :  Don't underestimate how difficult things like this are from a theoretical perspective. 

206 :  Lots of people here manage to be constructive and positive and I'd appreciate your effort in not starting fights with us or other contributors. 

207 :  Go and learn some manners! 

208 :  I've read about observable something, but why would I use the whole framework if I had to use another framework and do my own implementation? 

209 :  If they make fool of me it's not my fault 

210 :  So this means the whole framework is unpolished, untested and lazy coded. 

211 :  clearly you are feeling frustrated and angry right now. I can understand how that can happen. 

212 :  It is important that we work constructively to solve our problems and not resort to insults. 

213 :  I'm very sorry if this will cause you to leave Godot. 

214 :  I understand that some black people may not consider these terms offensive, but I would rather someone not want to work with me because they think I am too politically correct than because they think I am too insensitive and blind. 

215 :  Of course, if you @trivikr personally feel strongly about this then I support you :] 

216 :  If there's another way for this to work, I'm open to alternate ideas, but I think conditionally playbook imports would be generically useful. 

217 :  Please use the‘  button to let the maintainers know you need this feature. Getting a ton of emails from these +1s. 

218 :  I think you have a legitimate concern and I'm sorry if you feel like I'm ignoring you. 

219 :  I think you have a legitimate concern and I'm sorry if you feel like I'm ignoring you. 

220 :  do not you think that simply stating that I 'messed up writers" ' without explaining why is rude?" 

221 :  Look again, the name isn't Maui, the name is Multi-platform App UI which abbreviates to M.A.U.I. 

222 :  I hope this is not Microsoft's general attitude towards open source projects these days... 

223 :  bro I am an Open Source author and maintainer so don't try lecturing me about being against off-putting towards the open-source community"" 

224 :  That's not because others really love .NET, but because they try to stay constructive here. 

225 :  MauiKit whether you want to hear it or not has no fundamentals of what I as an Open Source Author and Maintainer would consider signs of a healthy project. 

226 :  We are talking about open source projects, there should be a common philosophy, not a competition for those who have the biggest issue counter. 

227 :  Sorry if I sounded harsh, that wasn't my intent. 

228 :  To be honest, this entire thread so far makes me far less inclined to introduce a dependency on the enterprise project. 

229 :  will have to move to a real open source tool like JMeter instead of gatling.  Sad. 

230 :  We are really sorry to hear this. 

231 :  Don't be so agitated 

232 :  For best outcome please consider writing your messages mindfully and calmly explaining both your problem and what is the suggested resolution or expectation for it. 

233 :  My sincere apologies.  I was in the wrong, and I've done you harm.  I'm sorry. 

234 :  Alex, sorry, I had gathered that you're recognized as the principle Windows maintainer. I didn't mean to invent a title. 

235 :  Well, I'm sorry for having been slightly edgy due to the total irrelevance of that statement with which he accompanies the news that he unblocked me. 

236 :  Let's be clear - you're telling *me* that I don't credit trade-offs or drawbacks, on a project I maintain, for a protocol that was designed a year ago, and for which noone has reported any automated breakage of any system, while still being able to migrate at the time of their choice. 

237 :  It's also been frustrating to be treated as a troll when I was called entitled but responded with a compliment. 

238 :  It was frustrating to see my point be misinterpreted as something else. 

239 :  I'm sorry if you felt your concern wasn't taken into consideration, I think it's simply because you believe, as you said, making future decisions based on trust is a mistake", while other people may not (I don't)." 

240 :  Think about that. 

241 :  I read some thoughtful and reasonable responses in this thread, and I understand how everyone has their point of view. 

242 :  Stop whining about that and remove the BLM from the site. 

243 :  grow some thicker skin and calm down. 

244 :  As a side note, the kind of errors hit by the users on the thread of this issue (lack of basic knowledge of Python for instance) tells me that we cannot solve their problem. 

245 :  He, being one of the top contributors to scikit-learn has to make tough decisions as to what will go into our codebase and what will not, as a more verbose documentation or tutorial might not be preferable for a lot of people. 

246 :  we understand your eagerness to solve your problem, and your frustration when it is not solved. 

247 :  I am very new in scikit-learn. 

248 :  I will be highly appreciated any useful advice. 

249 :  Sorry if this issue seems a bit salty, but it's really annoying 

250 :  I just lost hours worth of state because of this behavior. 

251 :  Just having automatic updates install upon next launch would be a perfectly fine behavior 

252 :  Unfortunately I am going to have to abandon it until this issue is fixed because I'm losing a lot of time and work every other week when an update is pushed and my long-running processes are lost. 

253 :  Don't act on theories! 

254 :  This is the second or third time I've been screwed over by Microsoft's shitty installation practices. 

255 :  The grass isn't greener on the other side... 

256 :  To be fair, @jeremylt, the 300hrs estimate was quite demotivating for me when I started. 

257 :  I don't believe anything I've said could fairly be labeled mansplaining, but I am sorry that I was curt 

258 :  This mistake is still haunting us years later, unfortunately. 

259 :  It's sad that I have to use such a long winded approach to try and defend its future and get certain parts of Microsoft to cooperate with other parts. 

260 :  Replace the template text and remove irrelevant text as the instruction says. 

261 :  I think it is more important that the main developer of Vim can concentrate on enhancing and improving Vim instead of having to change a workflow, that has been proven to be working well for the past 30 years. 

262 :  My words were met by defensiveness, ego, stubbornness, ignorance, and delusion. 

263 :  Starting a reply with the conversation is already over is not okay. 

264 :  Check out the web service to see how they want you to do it. If it's your own server, set it up properly. 

265 :  Make up your mind, updater… 

266 :  Have patience 

267 :  doesn't hurt to be polite. 

268 :  fork it, fix it, make a pull request and contribute. 

269 :  It seems here that Microsoft is taking an active approach to kill VB actively (as opposed to passive approach - just let it die by abandoning it). :-( 

270 :  I probably shouldn't make any more PR as they will fail. 

271 :  I feel my time creating that PR was wasted, so not rewarding, hence I'll think twice before making another PR. 

272 :  I feel my time creating that PR was wasted, so not rewarding, hence I'll think twice before making another PR. 

273 :  I'm sorry I don't have much time for other things beside work and family. 

274 :  I didn't realize a 4 line PR would pull me into a discussion on how to improve it by implementing a new code base and consequently figure why shippable would fail. 

275 :  I didn't realize a 4 line PR would pull me into a discussion on how to improve it by implementing a new code base and consequently figure why shippable would fail. 

276 :  Feel free do whatever you see fit, I'm off to other things, good luck & sorry for the noise. 

277 :  Feel free do whatever you see fit, I'm off to other things, good luck & sorry for the noise. 

278 :  I think it really has to do with time of day, traffic, alignment of the planets, etc. 

279 :  Sooooooooooooooo slowly :( 

280 :  My apologies for the frustration this issue has caused. 

281 :  It would be helpful if you could benchmark this with curl for reference. 

282 :  i wish Salt guys put the comments inside this source, listing all the bugs related to this module. 

283 :  i made quite many changes in that mounts.py - and now i am thinking about undoing almost all of them... Lack of any documentation... 

284 :  See... i know very little about Linux and nothing about Python, so i was googling everything i could think of :-) 

285 :  it is sad how fast you were to say Salt is all wrong and how protective you fet about OMV. 

286 :  Our customers have complained after opening the application for the first time :( 

287 :  Disappointing that this is not being considered high priority. 

288 :  Honestly, this issue made me re-consider of cross-platform frameworks being owned by the same company (Google here) will be supported at best, and ignoring quality metrics delivery on other platforms (iOS). 

289 :  The project needs lifesaving measures as it's community is dissatisfied enough to be discussing forks. 

290 :  Issues where opened and closed by the bot without any reponse, and nobody but you can do some critical things (merging pull requests, publishing fixes...). 

291 :  I hope people keep that vision in mind, when considering the near-term goals like providing prompt feedback directly on GitHub discussions, quick resolution for user-contributed PRs, maintenance releases etc. 

292 :  I do continue to feel pretty disappointed that the active project ownership that is so badly is still not coming in the near term. 

293 :  I agree your mind but really sad about results...  :-| 

294 :  PS : sorry for my poor english, frenchies are really bad with it :-) 

295 :  I love you Jack, for making SUI. I just hope you dont get crazy <3 

296 :  At the same time I must mention one thing: **you will not succeed on your own**. 

297 :  In that regard I find it highly confusing - and disrespectful imho - that you chose to ignore all suggestions to delegate power to trusted contributors who would like to help you to maintain SUI 2.x. 

298 :  PS: You will still be the captain ,) 

299 :  If you're just going to hack around with low level packets, then just use netty and don't bother us when things break. 

300 :  I understand that it won't be accepted, I'm not contesting that. 

301 :  be kind 

302 :  As a consumer of your product, I expect it to work as advertised 

303 :  So our apologies if some things take too long, or don't end up happening 

304 :  but it's wrong to blame the maintainers for this. 

305 :  Well I'm having trouble making a reproducer for this. 

306 :  it would be great if there was a built-in way to paginate a list Jekyll collection items on a page. 

307 :  it would be nice if there was a built in pagniation that worked for both post and collection items. 

308 :  would like to see Nested Collections. 

309 :  I would like to see [reading metadata in separate files] 

310 :  I would like to see the tags of collections included in site.tags. 

311 :  build in support for content blocks and components 

312 :  I'd very much love to have native support for Coffeescript in much the same manner as Sass. 

313 :  it would be great to have more interactions with github, like pulling profile information (contributions, avatar, ), releases data - and convert it for proper publication. 

314 :  I would like to see an automated tool like Webpack integrated into Jekyll to handle Sass and Javascript. 

315 :  I'd love to see Docker volume mounts work with Jekyll and Docker for Windows. 

316 :  I would love to see an offically supported page generator from data files. 

317 :  Make internal linking easier. 

318 :  Dont work with fb and google 

319 :  This is not the level of security awareness I expect Microsoft to have. 

320 :  work with your security teams to get the uploader qualified by at least the major vendors 

321 :  A company that does not understand the need of a full doc do not will offer a serious support in the long time 

322 :  Close this issue 

323 :  It would be nice to at least give an explanation before just closing an issue, this way nothing will get resolved, 

324 :  It would be nice to at least give an explanation before just closing an issue, this way nothing will get resolved, 

325 :  Wondering if Terminal users are mentally prepared to such amount of social activity in their lives.. switching from 0 social life to this directly might be... Overwhelming 

326 :  It's a fun-take and I wanted to upvote it for the fun part, but then I thought it may send the wrong message so I had to downvote it, just to not confuse newcomers. ,) 

327 :  The removal of the santa hat, and kowtowing to a fake user, is incredibly offensive to me. 

328 :  When I updated my VSCode, it was gone. 

329 :  If you don't do it I'll feel sad and disappointed. 

330 :  I'm deeply sorry for my insensitivity. 

331 :  Bring back the Santa's hat! 

332 :  I liked the santa hat, it brought a little joy to my day. Very sad that it has been removed. 

333 :  bring the hat back 

334 :  Bring back the hat. 

335 :  Put a satan hat back. 

336 :  add a Satan Hat! 

337 :  Assuming he was trolling: troll successful, gg 

338 :  I'm also not happy that the santa hat was removed, completely ignoring the public opinion here on GH. 

339 :  I def understand how frustrated you are, but every new platform has its shares of issues and stability. 

340 :  I understand you're frustrated, but having a positive attitude, even when you're stressed out or frustrated speaks volumes to others who are genuinely trying to help. 

341 :  Instead, when are you going to add REAL support for streaming?? 

342 :  I'm almost 40, and I bet I'm gonna die BEFORE you even get the idea to implement all of this!!! Pfffff............... 

343 :  that is painful 

344 :  Embrace the patterns of the npm ecosystem. 

345 :  Could you show me how to resolve this issue please? 

346 :  fork lerna and do it yourself. 

347 :  what a waste of time. 

348 :  We are talking things technically, don't make it personal. 

349 :  Calm down 

350 :  If you feel disrespect on nasty", I apologize." 

351 :  I think, you have many professional developers and why this F... RTL problem is not important for you? 

352 :  Why atom team don't like to fix this issue? 

353 :  Microsoft products are phenomenally bad and it's a wonder how you guys still stay in business. 

354 :  I suspect your whiteboarding hiring technique is ineffective and counterproductive. 

355 :  What's so special about installing .NET Core that it requires a different installation strategy? 

356 :  WTF? 

357 :  GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER MICROSOFT!!!! 

358 :  If I sound harsh, it's because I am sick and tired of Microsoft releasing half-baked products that don't work as expected. 

359 :  I would feel sorry for you guys like I would for the slow kid who klutzes around the basketball court, but this isn't your first time on the court with years of effort and tons of resources. 

360 :  It's why your own developers are using MacBook Pros for development. 

361 :  Telling us you are frustrated is fine, ranting is not. 

362 :  This is the kind of coding quality we get when corporations prioritizes employee diversity over code quality 

363 :  A thumbs down isn't enough on this one. There's zero tolerance for backwater attitude. Reporting. 

364 :  If people like me and you don't attempt it then we can wait another 3 years without anyone else picking the issue up. 

365 :  I am frankly fed up with this posture in open source projects. 

366 :  I've abandoned (a long time ago) the port effort and don't even use Dart anymore and will stop watching this rep. 

367 :  Why would I post this on the community site? I'm experiencing this problem on the travis-ci.com website?? 

368 :  you are showing how unappreciative and ignorant you can be. 

369 :  You can fault the devs for not getting this right with modules from the start, but aside from that, you should have more awareness of reality and what these changes have required before sharing those types of crass comments. 

370 :  In fact, you should probably not use any open source software, as the type of comment you left above are one of the major reasons why application developers give up on open source. 

371 :  Just because the software is open source doesn't mean we aren't paying for it. 

372 :  I honestly cannot believe how casual and dismissive you guys at MS are. 

373 :  I understand it must really difficult to do your job as a $1.75T company but can you try? 

374 :  Seeing you are happy to close issues and never respond to replies in closed issues, I am forced to open new issue. 

375 :  I would like to remind you that we are a small team of maintainers, and it has been less than or barely 24 hours since I responded to your issue yesterday. 

376 :  Telling users that they can use DSX but can't use debugger or enjoy auto-complete is a non starter for me. 

377 :  you are mixing everything I say and this conversation is going nowhere. In legal terms you are Badgering the witness"." 

378 :  I just don't have the time for this here. 

379 :  You failed to grasp that XML parsing (with some extra code to skip '{}' properly) is orders of magnitude simpler than fully parsing a programming language like Dart. 

380 :  you should invest you time and energy in writing up convincing arguments. 

381 :  You guys are suffering from NIH syndrome (Not-invented-here). Good artists copy, great artists steal", mediocre artists, well, behave like you." 

382 :  Really !!! nobody seems to bother to explain what exactly Flutter would gain... blah blah blah"." 

383 :  I don't want to argue against the feature but comments like if you don't do x then horribly y will happen" are just ridiculous." 

384 :  I think you underestimate how willing people are to try things, even when they're not fully polished. 

385 :  Obviously you didn't take my hint on length to heart but don't come to conclusions about my character because you don't know me at all. 

386 :  It is obvious to me that you are not very experienced with JSX, you really don't understand how it works. 

387 :  You are not the meter used to measure success and you don't know what I am up to. 

388 :  You equate me not having much experience with JSX and me not knowing how it works at all? 

389 :  my point still stands - that kind of comment is _still_ not appropriate here. 

390 :  Women can also be a construction worker  

391 :  This is the worst piece of advice anyone can give. 

392 :  Are you a I am the greatest dev alive" guy?" 

393 :  because if you even pause for a second to contemplate yes to any of those things you have a very rude awakening coming. 

394 :  It would also have been nice if you gave some actual reasoning behind your comment, not just flaming. 

395 :  I think I would rather become a rice farmer than ever touch WCF again. 

396 :  This is another good reason to not support WCF. Years of people implementing designs using WCF based on false assumptions or mythical functionality. 

397 :  If you don't like it, don't use it!!! 

398 :  Why try and stop others from using it? and most importantly why do so with absolutely no information just flaming? sorry but show me, tell me why? 

399 :  So, if this way of doing things is so terrible tell me why, don't just talk smack. Facts, Proof, Scientific Method... 

400 :  **I ask kindly post something informative and factual or just stop trolling.** 

401 :  Berating them to move to REST when it's impossible for them is neither clever nor helpful. 

402 :  This was last discussed more than five years ago and should be discussed again. 

403 :  for support reasons, you don't really have to ask what platform they're on, just mention the three paths in one sentence, it's actually rather easy. 

404 :  You're being a bit facetious. 

405 :  The third silly thing is that you're acting like IPython doesn't have any changes that break some pieces of code or tutorials out there. 

406 :  All in all it makes your comment seem more like irrational stubbornness than actual concerns. 

407 :  There's no need to update all the code and documentation all over the internet", nobody has every done that and never will." 

408 :  Now if it's to criticize the code without proper understanding of the technical and social reason of why it is the way it is, and bring XDG zealotry into the mix, I'm even less likely to make an effort. 

409 :  Also, your explanation still makes zero sense It's just re-identify the id if change" isn't even a proper sentence." 

410 :  Listen to his comment and stop suggesting this crudely thought-up bandaid of a fix"." 

411 :  Just PLEASE STOP. 

412 :  Care to explain why did you deleted my comment? 

413 :  Because it was completely inappropriate. Telling other contributors to not comment because you have no clue what you're talking about" is toxic behavior." 

414 :  Telling other contributors to not comment because you have no clue what you're talking about" is toxic behavior." 

415 :  While your contributions are clearly valuable, you need to accept that you're part of a larger community and need to treat others with respect. 

416 :  As such I don't care about what the code of conduct says because anyway I don't plan to contribute more work to this OSS project. 

417 :  Well, I consider his behavior to show a lack of respect for other's people work and time. 

418 :  Well, I appreciate they're appreciated but at the same time I don't really care. 

419 :  Nobody appreciates random/out of context quoting, straightforward answer avoidance, jumping to conclusions and whatnot. 

420 :  Working for fun doesn't imply that you get to do whatever you want and that there are no consequences. 

421 :  You shield yourself in the code of conduct and go OMG, how could people dare telling me that I'm wrong? 

422 :  Or perhaps you try to do better next time and avoid the not so fun part of messing up? 

423 :  And if you really do not know what you are talking about then what? 

424 :  Instead of an answer I've got some gibberish that tries to pass as code review or whatever that is supposed to be. 

425 :  It's exactly this unwillingness to learn from mistakes that brought us here. 

426 :  Feel free to continue to go down this path, the only thing you'll achieve is to dig the hole deeper. 

427 :  Yet here you are, telling me exactly that. 

428 :  Telling him that he doesn't know what he's talking about is unacceptable. 

429 :  If you want other people to learn, you need to give them more information beyond you're wrong"." 

430 :  You're basically sending him the signal of you're not welcome here"." 

431 :  if we observe behavior like this in the future, we'll ultimately block you. 

432 :  We can't have other contributors stop engaging with us because of your behavior. While your contributions are valued, they don't warrant losing other contributors as collateral damage. 

433 :  But instead of apologizing or even just letting that feedback sink in, you're now trying to turn the tables by saying you got victimized by Tanner because he asked you a technical question and that it's unreasonable from our end to ask you to be respectful in your responses to him. 

434 :  But instead of apologizing or even just letting that feedback sink in, you're now trying to turn the tables by saying you got victimized by Tanner because he asked you a technical question and that it's unreasonable from our end to ask you to be respectful in your responses to him. 

435 :  Oh, you gotta be joking. 

436 :  If you do not follow - can you ask other collaborators for help? 

437 :  Great attitude, especially as a _fastlane_ collaborator. Why not say it in here publicly? 

438 :  So instead of having a discussion and providing a counter example or presenting **any** reasoning why something would not be implemented, you are just discouraging people from helping _fastlane_... 

439 :  This is highly inappropriate. 

440 :  Do you really wonder why I don't want to spend any more time helping you? 

441 :  Mentioning other contributors that have not participated in the discussion is inappropriate as well, by the way. 

442 :  I do not think that looking for help in other contributors was inappropriate in that case as you clearly didn't want to take care of this issue. 

443 :  If people started paying for packages then they would be a lot more careful about the crap they select. 

444 :  YOU choose to spend your time on this project. 

445 :  If you aren't willing to contribute your code or your ideas to open source and aren't willing to contribute to projects monetarily, you should consider tempering your views. 

446 :  You guys seriously don't see what this guy is doing? He's trying to push his ESLint config as a standard" and monetize it." 

447 :  Not when that feedback is 100% predicable because it's nothing but our inner two year old being triggered to whine when everything doesn't go 100% his or her way. 

448 :  To place a copyleft licence on the work and then complain that you can't monetize it because people are copying it for free is an... interesting complaint. 

449 :  What an awful and misleading name for a eslint config. 

450 :  No, not all humans have this reaction.  The reaction you are projecting on all humans infers that all humans are greedy, inconsiderate thieves. 

451 :  Not letting your inner two year old rule you does not mean he is not present.  His complaints are predictable, and those who are voicing complaints from him are not needed. 

452 :  Please take your pseudo-intellectual garbage elsewhere 

453 :  Calling people triggered whining two-year olds doesn't contribute to this discussion constructively. 

454 :  should be ashamed of himself. 

455 :  It would be appreciable and civilized if you stopped calling the other's point of view &mdash, or the point of view you think they hold &mdash, stupid"." 

456 :  It would be appreciable and civilized if you stopped calling the other's point of view &mdash, or the point of view you think they hold &mdash, stupid"." 

457 :  Even worse, you don't seem to try to understand the other side point of view, and rush to your own conclusions. 

458 :  You move from **assumptions**,  **contracts** to **communicating**. 

459 :  Comparisons to Hitler are neither necessary nor welcome here, and anyone unable to debate the merits of *versioning schemes* without relying on that as a rhetorical device should rethink whether their participation here is going to lead to a constructive conversation. 

460 :  Is Microsoft's official answer to reporting a serious performance regression in a subsystem used every day by developers and admins who are managing and maintaining their user base really yeah we are aware of it but whether we will fix it and when, who knows"?" 

461 :  if you're unhappy with how the console is performing, go ahead and switch back to legacy mode. 

462 :  Don't struggle with this, Mike.  Again, if your mythical twenty year old stuff" doesn't work with the new Windows 10 console, by all means, use the old console, link in ANSICON, and keep relying on monkeypatching GetProcAddress (euughhhh)." 

463 :  In other words you want someone else to do the work for you „ 

464 :  You got the report and the working samples. 

465 :  So in your opinion you're free to mess it up, isn't it? 

466 :  Grow up first! 

467 :  Please stop collecting MY data and remove telemetry from all your f**g Windows products. 

468 :  Be thankful. Microsoft uses the data to improve your calculating experience. :smile: 

469 :  Just hoping Microsoft will not put backdoor, telemetry, obfuscation and all its shit in all Github projects, like others did in SourceForge. 

470 :  Just because a product is open-sourced doesn't mean you can go around making demands in this manner. 

471 :  I don't respect people who want to collect my PRIVATE data with software. 

472 :  If you don't like my demand, delete it. 

473 :  If you want better software, delete all these malwares. 

474 :  Because everybody today is speaking on the Net about a Windows Calculator with telemetry inside. I didn't believe even that was possible and... yes. 

475 :  What isn't respectful is polluting the issue-catalog with useless rants, poorly hidden profanity and shouting. 

476 :  I am, however, done with this issue now. 

477 :  you guys are worried about what data the calculator is collecting? what about the rest of windows lol 

478 :  You are not Calculator King of the Internet. 

479 :  A lot of time is being wasted doing what I've already done. 

480 :  The only negative opinions I get are from trolls or people who need an excuse for why they suck at the game. 

481 :  I do NOT need to upgrade, you miss the point. 

482 :  Avoiding Win10 is intentional, because I don't want my PC to have buggy, ugly, spying rubbish. 

483 :  I however suspect your comments are a little disingenuous 

484 :  you are entitled to believe what you like, but Windows 7 is coming to an end, and if you do not wish to remain a Windows user, there is macOS and various forms of Linux, for you to choose from. 

485 :  This isn't some Reddit thread for you to vent. 

486 :  Shortly, it's THE WORST system MS made (after Millenium). 

487 :  That's why I feel disappointed(angry) that you support Win10 and WITHOUT ANY REASON drop support for Win7. 

488 :  And funny, but NOT A SINGLE ANSWER were given by... hm... professionals"." 

489 :  You really need to take a step back and consider how you present yourself publicly. 

490 :  I have no desire to provide a professional response based on your attitude. 

491 :  This is absolutely unacceptable behavior 

492 :  Whoever came up with this idea clearly doesn't understand why ESLint was created in the first place. 

493 :  There are plenty of domains where you would like to give a function a name beginning with use"." 

494 :  You're not paying for it and the maintainers of this tool don't owe you anything. 

495 :  When you do post a complaint, you'll maximize your chances of getting what you want by avoiding incendiary language like absolutely unacceptable", "screaming", "atrocious", "carelessly", and "doesn't understand"." 

496 :  what's fuck google do? flutter is yours,golang is yours, why can't they live together? 

497 :  @akien-mga and other contributors.. get your shit together 

498 :  Whether it was a mistake or not is not decided by you, but the community as a whole. 

499 :  You are not the center of the universe. 

500 :  I have no idea what you are so angry about, just chill man. 

501 :  the only way someone can convince someone else to work on something on this project is good arguments from one side and the will to do it from the other side. 

502 :  you come off as quite hostile. 

503 :  I feel like I've seen you troll (that's what your comments amount to really) other GitHub projects also but I won't bother to check. Life is too short‹» 

504 :  you also completely dodged my point about the smiley emoji implementations. so i recommend a good feature for the engine **(inventory and other 2d stuff, that ALL GAME DEVELOPERS WILL BENEFIT FROM)**, but **you spit in my face**, claim that it's not low level enough", but then go around merging PRs for "emoji smiley" support for fonts? that's somehow still low level though? wtf??" 

505 :  so much for open source"." 

506 :  wtf?? 

507 :  can't have discussions without bypassing  / cheating github it seems! 

508 :  it's really hard for me to sit back and ignore what these companies are doing with my code. 

509 :  I have trouble expressing how angry this makes me feel. 

510 :  Do parents" who drag their children across the desert with the express intent of illegally entering the United States have no share of blame for what happens to these children?" 

511 :  It says nothing about people giving money to e.g. Microsoft or using Microsoft products. 

512 :  Maybe they would have dropped in to tell us it won't be accepted and not to waste any effort on it? 

513 :  go listen to them and stop relying on those soulless motherfuckers at Facebook to give a damn about you. 

514 :  to be honest, this response is borderline unacceptable and I don't even know what to reply. Wow. 

515 :  What the actual hell is your goal here? 

516 :  You're screwing Lerna, not the companies listed 

517 :  Meanwhile you're getting massive community backlash that's only going to continue if you decide to be a child and inappropriately release this as a minor version bump or with the MIT license. 

518 :  The best thing feasible for Lerna at this point is you leaving the project 

519 :  The best thing feasible for Lerna at this point is you leaving the project 

520 :  the second best thing is everyone moving to a fork of the project without a politician having any control. 

521 :  The irony is I 100% agree with your politics, but this is not the place to express them. 

522 :  it sucks if I have to spend my evening checking a bunch of old repos because you'll _maybe_ release this as a patch. 

523 :  So I fucked off and told them to eat shit. 

524 :  Once upon a time I thought I had to go work for those big corporations that I hate in order to do the kind of open source work I want to do. That turned out to be incredibly false. So I fucked off and told them to eat shit. 

525 :  If you want to restrict who can use lerna, then lerna can no longer be called free, it will be proprietary. 

526 :  Calls for civility are perfectly apt after an issue like this. Suggesting that asking people to be nice" is an attempt at ending discussion is one of the strangest stretches I've ever heard. As someone that called maintainers cowards for reverting the changes and removing Jamie, I can get a strong sense of why you'd argue that point, however." 

527 :  do you really want transparency, or are you looking for a fight? 

528 :  If you're looking for rancorous sniping and harmful drama" you might try using a mirror." 

529 :  Explain how me, the person who made the decision, not employed by Microsoft, was secretly paid by Microsoft to ruin open source. Should be an amusing story. 

530 :  So for all this grandstanding you're doing -- why not delete your GitHub account...seriously -- MS will own GitHub soon. Also -- change your OS from Windows -- if you use that... 

531 :  Oh Jesus nevermind -- I'm an idiot I guess :joy: -- apologies :) 

532 :  Sure, I'm sure you could argue Adolf was a pretty cool guy if you ignore all the other stuff he did and just focus on his gun control policy. ”¥ 

533 :  This is really frustrating 

534 :  This is stupid! 

535 :  There is a bug here and posting that this is fixed is misleading. 

536 :  Honest question: does anybody read what I've been posting about this issue? 

537 :  Did you actually read the thread? 

538 :  The problem is nbot the ability to permanently remove files, please the first message of the issue... It's explicit. 

539 :  You assumed the most common error was because `gvfs-trash` was not installed. 

540 :  This thread is the proof it's no more the case. Please, update. 

541 :  I would direct people to actually read the bug report before commenting. 

542 :  Well great let me just ship your computer around so everyone can use it. 

543 :  Or even better we will buy everyone a plane ticket and then can come stand in line to use your computer where the software does work. 

544 :  I dont understand why people working for google have such a problem admting they make mistakes...  everybody does, what makes difference is fix them or not. 

545 :  i cant even imagine a meeting to present the product: Here we have a new tool that will allow developers to set constants remotelly, helping with A/B tests and allowing the developer to change apps behavior without re-deploy." 

546 :  You just told me that if someone has an app in both architectures and want to use the default values THIS PERSON MUST DEFINE EVERY FIELD 3 TIMES... does it sound smart? 

547 :  I hate to be rude and also hate to teach people how to do their jobs. but this architecture design of firebase RC is a clear mistake, anyone with a basic software engineer understand should be able to see that. 

548 :  I'm sorry to tell you but this isnt frustrating" this is a super stupid architecture design..." 

549 :  This is very much a case of Old Microsoft" rearing it's head, rather then new forward looking Microsoft." 

550 :  We can disagree here and have debates, but please halt yourself before assuming the motivations of others and attacking individuals personally or their work. 

551 :  If you're unhappy with them, you're absolutely free to change them. 

552 :  did you perhaps recognise the truth of what I wrote and felt defensive? 

553 :  I am so tempted to chime in with something more confrontational but I don't think it'll add to the debate 

554 :  if you expect it to meet all your needs straight away you probably need to realign your expectations. 

555 :  you're getting a little extreme. 

556 :  Good recommendation, but the you'll sound like Yoda" is too informal for a disclaimer." 

557 :  **I REALLY DISAGREE WITH THIS PR** 

558 :  This is actually nonsensical statement. 

559 :  you are being overly defensive when the whole argument was about Godot, not BGFX. 

560 :  You seem to be assuming that just because of adding BGFX support, everything will be fine and no one will ever have to learn how the underlying APIs work. 

561 :  thanks a lot for your enthusiasm, but I am the one doing the rendering work in Godot, not you. 

562 :  As always with Godot, you are free to make your own renderer with BGFX, show me that it's flawless, has better better performance, works better than mine (of course while supporting the full Godot feature set) and uses less resources and code to prove me wrong.. as well as commiting full time over the next years to maintain it. 

563 :  If you want a revolution, begin with it yourself. 

564 :  If you want to prove your ideas, invest in them because words are free. 

565 :  What a classic example of elitism and douchebaggery. 

566 :  I will stay miles away from Godot and any projects you maintain, thanks. 

567 :  I will stay miles away from Godot and any projects you maintain, thanks. 

568 :  Nobody's saying it shouldn't use the network. 

569 :  It just shouldn't use the network *before the user has given it permission*, because otherwise it is a **data leak**. 

570 :  That's *why the consent dialog exists*. 

571 :  That seems to be a recurring issue 

572 :  You need to reopen this one too, because, inconvenient or not, autoupdate checks are also an inadvertent form of telemetry *whether the project uses them for the purpose or not*. 

573 :  It doesn't matter if the telemetry is coming from the telemetry package" or not." 

574 :  As already stated, if that form of telemetry" is an issue for you feel free to block the network access or create a version of Atom that doesn't check for updates." 

575 :  What about the thousands of other users who haven't spent time and money on things like Little Snitch, who nevertheless don't want to be tracked and explicitly opt out of telemetry that still get telemetry sent (and logged by their government forever) against their wishes? 

576 :  If you're going to insist on the autoupdate thing, couldn't you just do it once per month, at a random number of cumulative hours delay (say, 1-12) after startup, so that it doesn't function as an ad hoc user has launched the app" telemetry event to everyone watching and logging the network?" 

577 :  If you're going to insist on the autoupdate thing, couldn't you just do it once per month, at a random number of cumulative hours delay (say, 1-12) after startup, so that it doesn't function as an ad hoc user has launched the app" telemetry event to everyone watching and logging the network?" 

578 :  As I have stated multiple times you can definitely work with Atom while offline (or with network requests blocked). 

579 :  I do think that while delivered in a dictatorial manner, comment is worth discussing more. 

580 :  Aww.. Here, have a beer on me: :beer: 

581 :  There is also room now to put Google Ads in the exception messages. 

582 :  If you, or somebody else, think Node.js *should* address one of the particular concerns, and are willing to help in making that happen, Im sure we can arrange that. :slightly_smiling_face: 

583 :  Largely a duplicate of #19826 from earlier this year.  The answer is still 'no'. 

584 :  If you don't have anything relevant to say, stay quiet 

585 :  Your heavy-handed and dismissive approach to moderation diminishes the project and the whole community. 

586 :  Just because you are afraid taking responsibility doesn't mean someone else won't step up to it. 

587 :  Just because you are afraid taking responsibility doesn't mean someone else won't step up to it. 

588 :  You suck at it. 

589 :  it's bullshit solution. 

590 :  It's hard to predict what you want, because it's not clear what you want. 

591 :  Jesus, I wish you guys STFU and get back to work instead. 

592 :  Too bad maintainers do not mute the thread. 

593 :  I'll have to unsubscribe from the ticket because it's unbearable to get emails with flame wars. 

594 :  I've been spending WAY too much time on adding bootstrap 4 with npm to a webpack project. 

595 :  I just installed, included, imported and my app just runs fine, no errors, but yet no col-md or container styling working.. meh, i'll just return to CDN's... 

596 :  But also, I don't want to be mean but I would prefer not to have this kind of discussions. 

597 :  This is once again NOT a bug and it is up to you to now change the way you deal with your animations. 

598 :  If you don't want to call it a bug, it's very bad design at the very least. 

599 :  I am **once again**, going to explain how the frame property works within the engine: you select a frame, which is numbered from left to right, then from top to bottom. 

600 :  And once again, there is nothing to fix here, unless you have a real solution" to the problem." 

601 :  we won't solve your problem by introducing workarounds in the code, sorry. 

602 :  What the hell? 

603 :  Your issue doesn't contain a single bit of useful information anybody could act on. 

604 :  At best the problem is that your expectations are wrong and you blame Angular instead of adjusting yourself, and the worse case is that you are just spreading spam. 

605 :  Angular works great for most. If it doesn't for you it's highly likely the problem is on your end. 

606 :  You need to stop acting like 3-year old. 

607 :  You need to stop acting like 3-year old. 

608 :  Grow up, get your sh*t together and stop spamming. 

609 :  don't cry, contributor, you are not blame that you are into that sh*t 

610 :  the reality is just opposite, it is the very suitable framework especially for real big projects. Just to guess, your problem is probably that you see it / try to use it by the same way as from jQuery point of view which is totally wrong way. 

611 :  whats the problem to answer this question? 

612 :  I don't even understand what the problem is and you don't seem to be interested to explain it. 

613 :  I don't even understand what the problem is and you don't seem to be interested to explain it. 

614 :  LOL - you simply closed my issue - where is your interest? 

615 :  LOL - you simply closed my issue - where is your interest? 

616 :  Because you do not know the answer about the raw response in gitter? 

617 :  I don't even care if that is directly in your code or was pulled in via a dependency bump. 

618 :  I'd say that's much worse than a temporarily broken build. 

619 :  I'm sorry my fuckups have caused you pain. 

620 :  And even if you do feel there is responsibility, you should not be so rude. 

621 :  Unintended breaking changes happen, but blaming it on the consumers is not an appropriate response. 

622 :  your reaction to the mistake being brought to your intention is somewhere between condescending and hostile. 

623 :  Instead you said that it's good that your mistake broke my build. 

624 :  You could have said sorry, this was not intended, let me roll back and re-release as 4.0.0" and it would be fine." 

625 :  You could have said sorry, I didn't consider that the yargs API practically becomes part of the lerna API, I will make sure that future SemVer major updates of yargs only happen in SemVer major updates of lerna"" 

626 :  However, I do see much evidence that you are trying to crash through head first through Angular and I see it as you feel it should just work the way you want it to... 

627 :  You either consume it all OR you will be wingin' it" and fighting the current of how things actually work versus how you want them to work." 

628 :  **angular team doesn't care about users feedback at all** 

629 :  Soooooooooooo youre setting Angular on fire and saying bold shit in bold like the Angular team dont care about you cause you found relative pathing has an issue is an odd area 

630 :  I felt Angular 2 to Angular 4 stuck it to me in the ace hole butttttttttttttt alas past my bitching, it all was for the better 

631 :  The topic here has just been a bunch of bitching where I have found success in the CLI and lazy loading. 

632 :  Im NOT going to create some plunked to split hairs with you 

633 :  Unprofessional for Flutter team to have this issue for more than 1 year. 

634 :  It is just shows up the whole Google company style - quantity over quality. 

635 :  may I remind you of the code of conduct of this repository which strongly encourages a kind behaviour? 

636 :  you are really think that is the Apple's problem? 

637 :  No one is even assigned to this issue yet? 

638 :  Guys from Flutter team, you spend tone of time to learn algorithms, data structure, low level programming for get work in Google and for now is it actually that type of solution you wanna provide being hired by the one of the best company in the world? Crutch? 

639 :  Guys from Flutter team, you spend tone of time to learn algorithms, data structure, low level programming for get work in Google and for now is it actually that type of solution you wanna provide being hired by the one of the best company in the world? Crutch? 

640 :  When you solve this issue(instead of provide workaround) Flutter will be best SaaS decision in the world, even for iOS users! 

641 :  I wonder why neither my proposal of shipping MSL nor the proposal of an optimisation run got a response from anyone from the team. 

642 :  Guys, I think we should start reaching out to the press about this issue. 

643 :  Ultimately the priorities of the flutter dev team are set by business stakeholders, I think. 

644 :  Show us ONE request from ANYONE who asked for their TABs to be changed to spaces within their code when using the option KEEP TABS. 

645 :  Come on people, this is not rocket science, it's a text editor for $(Deity)'s sake! 

646 :  Obviously it's more convient to blindly deny it here rather than simply fix it. 

647 :  How about not commenting before understanding what you read? 

648 :  You butted into the middle of a discussion by putting words in my mouth because you haven't bothered to understand what I wrote. 

649 :  So now you are implying that I don't even know what I want? 

650 :  What's next, telling me to get used to doing things your way because reasons? 

651 :  If this is a feature, and not a bug, then someone please explain why, when **Always keep TABs** is selected, these TABs are being replaced by Spaces? 

652 :  It's VERY unpredictable and frustrating. 

653 :  It may be worse for you, but better for others.  Hence the dilemma :) 

654 :  You'd see things very differently if on some lines of your code, your spaces were constantly being replaced by tabs. 

655 :  99% of what you wrote translates into excuses to not even attempt to change anything because something could break while at the same time you are totally disregarding that it has already been broken for us, hence the bug reports. 

656 :  99% of what you wrote translates into excuses to not even attempt to change anything because something could break while at the same time you are totally disregarding that it has already been broken for us, hence the bug reports. 

657 :  it is clear that you enjoy imposing your way on others given your ban on tabs" which you mentioned above." 

658 :  So far you have not addressed any of my points, instead you keep spouting some weird mix of anti-tab religious zealotry and corporate PR talk. 

659 :  At the risk of getting banned from commenting on this and every other Microsoft repo I am going to call you out on your bullshit -- you, Sir, are full of it and presenting rational arguments to you is a colossal waste of time. 

660 :  At the risk of getting banned from commenting on this and every other Microsoft repo I am going to call you out on your bullshit -- you, Sir, are full of it and presenting rational arguments to you is a colossal waste of time. 

661 :  i am out of here, and I will be advocating in my company to drop Visual Studio licensing. 

662 :  Maybe you will learn to honor user's preferences when they hit you in the wallet. 

663 :  It's open for God knows for how long just like this one. 

664 :  This misbehavior on tabs was reported shortly after the release of the VS2015 version, multiple times, by different people. 

665 :  You developed an new auto format engine and it fails to give the same good experience as the one that was used before and instead of fixing it, you prefer to spend hours of discussion with arguments that have nothing to do with the given issue. 

666 :  How much patience do you expect, by people that have to deal with this bug on every day? 

667 :  That is NOT expected behaviour. 

668 :  And today here we are approx. 6 years since the release of Visual Studio 2015 where the issue was introduced and you are telling me that you need more time to make sure someone is not negatively impacted while people using tabs are negatively impacted for 6 years and counting. 

669 :  I hope by now you are noticing a pattern, because the same kind of discussion is going on here as well. 

670 :  If you do bother to read those discussions as I asked you to, you will hopefully see how much of my personal time and effort I have spent on submitting the issue, and explaining things that Microsoft's own software engineers should have known better than me. 

671 :  In case what I am hinting at isn't clear, the difference is that I am a customer who is paying for the OS and dev tools licenses who is spending own free time to help improve things, and your colleagues are doing this on the salary and with this kind of response I am getting I have absolutely no incentive to contribute further. 

672 :  I have the urge to drop Microsoft products and suggest to the company I work for that we do the same wherever we can 

673 :  So no other editor exhibits this behaviour, no editor before 2015 exhibited this behaviour, people are here reporting it as a bug, but you're are suggesting that it fixed some problem endemic since the dawn of computing. 

674 :  That's bemusing to me, but if you're happy with it, then lucky you. 

675 :  Why It's not working? >:E There is no objective reasons for that. 

676 :  Do not distract me for this nonsense 

677 :  It would be much easier to understand if you simplified the example somewhat (remove the extra calls inside your auth service) and explained what you're actually looking for. 

678 :  This issue doesn't provide the steps to reproduce, or the exact expectation you're looking for with the example provided. 

679 :  i am from india my name is ramjeet widevin is shit .!! 

680 :  I'll be brief: It's because of guys like you that this device is being revoked. 

681 :  You - the person creating this issue is shit btw 

682 :  not widevine or the player, not even hiding the fact that you're using decryption keys illegally. 

683 :  It's because of people like you that real device owners and users can't use their devices as expected anymore. 

684 :  if you violate our code of conduct again, you will be permanently banned. 

685 :  Why is this issue still assigned to the `2.5 milestone` when `ansible 2.5` is already release a long time ago ? 

686 :  Running into this issue again and it sucks. 

687 :  Please guys, this issue has been open for almost 2 years now and for people who really use ansible-vault, this is a major pain the butt. 

688 :  We need a new free option, this is a core component and cannot be outsourced to 3rd party companies.  **THIS IS TOO CRITICAL** 

689 :  If you can't afford $1500 a year for IdentityServer4 to manage something as critical as identity for your business applications, drop them a line and let them know - pricing software products is a complicated business. 

690 :  OSS software isn't about other people doing things for you for free 

691 :  Funny how while it's been free, depending on 3rd parties has never been a problem... 

692 :  we'll make an announcement when ready"" 

693 :  Microsoft doesn't have to own everything dotnet. 

694 :  The sky isn't falling. 

695 :  If the answer is none" then _you're the problem_." 

696 :  I don't expect some - again VERY BASIC - functionality in my tech stack to change the licence 180°. 

697 :  It was their mistake to promote IS in the first place without making sure that it keeps the same license **forever** 

698 :  What an idi0t, not ok, just because he dont agree with someone else view. 

699 :   is out of line with personal comments like that. 

700 :  Clearly there's complexity in auth in general and within IS, and let's not pretend otherwise. 

701 :  Some of you were hopping over the line, some of you hopped over it, sprinted in the wrong direction and then threw things from 2.7 miles past the line. 

702 :  In any case, this is not the venue to discuss Duende's pricing, what open source means, and whether Microsoft should produce everything and kill off the .NET open source ecosystem in the process. 

703 :  We're done here and I'm locking the issue. 

704 :  Go linters complain when exported variables or constants are not documented (despite them being obvious in many cases), yet when core developers make major changes to go, they keep the old documentation, and don't even bother making it up-to-date. 

705 :  It was a neutral-tone, you might have never actually attached or imagined negative connotations to it if it weren't for me saying excuse me for my tone", which I have only said because I know how often people imagine hostility where there is none. :relaxed:" 

706 :  I cannot control how other people feel about me, and what emotions they attach to my statements. 

707 :  Despite what you say your words and actions do have a large impact on how people feel about what you write and how people interact with you. 

708 :  currently ` Dart` is more like: You want to do web? Sure, use AngularDart." (Hint: AngularDart != "the web")" 

709 :  LOL, no way. 

710 :  My commit is PUBLIC DOMAIN, do with it as you please. 

711 :  Perhaps also ask the lawyers what happens if someone later goes and fixes that typo. Thats basically stealing my public domain idea, regardless of your CLA, and then claiming it isnt because this wasnt known to you. 

712 :  Whacky position to be in :) 

713 :  Someone should start a GoFundMe campaign to pay for a lawyer who will challenge Google all the way to the Supreme Court, LOL 

714 :  I have OCD and I really want that typo fixed, now I know its there, it annoys me LOL. 

715 :  Can we please go back to focus on the issue at hand now, instead of having a meta discussion about how long people have had to test this. It is what it is right now, so let's look forward. 

716 :  I am amazed by how you, as the teacher, managed to avoiding pronouncing _any_ of the directives as en-gee" during the whole workshop." 

717 :  Did the girl really not notice the pattern of `ng-app`-`ng-init`-`ng-model`-`ng-if` leading to `ng-repeat`? 

718 :  Being curious about an official origin doesn't mean you're confused. 

719 :  a question on StackOverflow asking for the etymology of the `ng-` prefix is by no means evidence that it is a confusing name"." 

720 :  The project is already as inclusive as it gets: _everyone_ is welcome to use it and participate in its evolution by contributing, pointing out bugs, asking questions and helping others. Changing `ng-` to `ang-` would not affect this fact, positively or negatively. 

721 :  Furthermore, I am amazed by how you, as the teacher, managed to avoiding pronouncing _any_ of the directives as en-gee" during the whole workshop." 

722 :  I find it fascinating that someone at an Angular workshop was confused. 

723 :  Also, it would certainly not be easier to remember" because that would mean changing every existing material online." 

724 :  By this logic ang- is a terrible choice as it could stand for anything from negative words like ang-ry to religious words like ang-el. 

725 :  Trying to find two or three letters that are universally innocent in every language in a way that you cannot somehow turn them into something negative is probably an impossible task. 

726 :  Responding to that feeling by saying, basically, you are wrong" is practically providing proof that the angular community is not that welcoming." 

727 :  That sentence reads as a euphemism for that girl is stupid". Again: Not. Welcoming." 

728 :  Great, I'm glad you don't interpret `ng-repeat` negatively. 

729 :  It's so unbelievably annoying! 

730 :  This keeps coming up and it is SO ANNOYING. 

731 :  The people who's job it is to improve Visual Studio's user experience would be better equipped to fix this. 

732 :  Teams prioritizing things different from you is not negligence. 

733 :  The (ir)responsible team at Microsoft is neglecting a lot of users by not fixing this bug. 

734 :  It is a minor issue" in that it'd be easy for them to fix, although the choose not to.  It's not a "minor issue" in that it is indeed super annoying." 

735 :  And, as mentioned above, if that order doesn't fit your desires, you actually have something you can do about it. 

736 :  You seem to be seeking some sort of recognition and I must concede it to you. 

737 :  You have a knack for justifying inaction. 

738 :  I don't have time.  Nor really for this pointless discussion, although I hope you got something out of it at least. 

739 :  If you view my willingness to work with you to fix hte issues you care about as inaction" then that's on you." 

740 :  Thus it would be very unreasonable to expect app developers to do _even more_ work in the form of _unpaid_ casual side-jobs for various other projects such as Visual Studio etc, while simultaneously trying to perform their normal job 

741 :  It would be wildly unreasonable to expect app developers to sacrifice all of the following.  * Sacrifice mental health (re burn-out) as a consequence of excessive workload / unpaid side-jobs. * Sacrifice the proper raising of own children (applicable to everyone that has children), because of excessive time and energy spent doing unpaid side-jobs, resulting in insufficient time/energy remaining to properly raise and take care of children. * Sacrifice the relationship with partner/girlfriend/boyfriend/wife/husband. * Sacrifice a healthy amount of social life with friends and relatives (this loss can also lead to degradation of mental health). * Sacrifice relaxation/leisure time (insufficient leisure time also damages mental health). * Sacrifice fair working conditions and remuneration for staff members of businesses. * Sacrifice ethical behavior. 

742 :  However, it would be wildly unreasonable to expect to sacrifice himself like you do. 

743 :  My personal opinion is that your behavior appears to be unethical, inappropriate, and unprofessional, and it does not belong in any GitHub repository linked with Microsoft. 

744 :  Does that not strike you as ridiculous? 

745 :  You seem strangely passionate about defending their inaction. 

746 :  This is a delightful vignette about why we have rebindable key actions, and why we don't want to be prescriptive with user experience where terminal input" is concerned." 

747 :  your comment makes zero sense here. 

748 :  What C++ and/or Swift do isn't part of our decision making process for C#. 

749 :  'annoying' was not part of the decision making process. 

750 :  The language direction is not decided by polls. 

751 :  It should not be about believing or feeling ... It is not technical terms, there is should be Mind Map - what this feature will provide and allow to achieve ... 

752 :  It is entirely about that.  The language design group chooses which features are added to the language based on their personal beliefs and feelings. 

753 :  You underestimate our real usage 

754 :  Because he's continually said that this proposal had been rejected, he's said why it was rejected, and thus all this complaining on a rejected issue is just noise. 

755 :  If you want to talk about it further, do so where you have been asked to go. 

756 :  If you don't want to do that, you obviously don't care as much about your proposal as you seem to. 

757 :  This isn't your language. If it was, you'd be free to make all the changes you want, whatever the consequences, but it isn't. 

758 :  This isn't your language. 

759 :  Whether you did that or not is entirely up to you, but please stop moaning here, as you have been politely asked to do multiple times... 

760 :  I've seen you get upset and belligerent before when a proposal didn't go the way you wanted - it's getting old. 

761 :  But then the argument and debate must go into the gutter like chat channel to make it easier to forget, that's all reasoning I could understand about why we need to go there, the team just don't want to listen or even have clear evidence that people appeared to go against your decision (I might be overthinking things but this was one technique a dictator would used to suppress opinion of people) 

762 :  But for assumption that this feature will have `minimal usage` is very unlikely and very vague argument 

763 :  But not only there are no further explanation, you just demand people voice's to be drained into gitter and discord instead of the issue topic itself. 

764 :  This is what I really would called unreasonable 

765 :  But now you just don't want discussion to be under the issue and we don't have reason why it changed 

766 :  NOISE!! 

767 :  The difference is that those people gracefully did as was suggested as opposed to continually whine. 

768 :  You are acting like a petulant child, so I ask once again, if you're not willing to follow Cyrus' suggestion to move this discussion, PLEASE STOP! 

769 :  You seem to have some entitled opinion that just because you would find something useful, everybody else must, and thus it must be included in the language, and you're not willing to accept no" as an answer." 

770 :  END. FINIS. DONE. 

771 :  The decision making process is not done in a measured or mechanical fashion. 

772 :  This entire meta discussion on how people want the language designed is not useful here. 

773 :  (insert ominous music here) 

774 :  You guys aren't big fans of the KISS principle, I see. 

775 :  Microsoft once again doesn't fail to disappoint. 

776 :  my next action will be to get rid of this software immediately. 

777 :  I _dont_ appreciate you expressing it by heaping it on top of everybody I work with. 

778 :  Hi! Im a real person, happy to have a dialogue about that. 

779 :  This isn't the first time Microsoft is forcing good ideas" down my throat - if it was, I'd be happy to ask you about them directly, but this is just another data-point in a long history of similarly user-hostile actions." 

780 :  The irony of this statement is significant. You are literally clueing the user in to the opposite. I performed a customisation, and it is undone. This doesn't appear to be customisable"" 

781 :  You're right that our userbase is a technical audience, which is why we expected them to be able to <!--rub two brain cells together, and-->take the four seconds it takes to read the synthesized JSON, see the `hidden": false` that we stick in there, and think "hmm, maybe that hides the profile ”"." 

782 :  How about ASKING THE USER? Did that ever cross your mind? 

783 :  Hey, I've detected that you've made a change in the config. I'm about to undo all your work and confuse the hell out of you, Would you like me to continue?"" 

784 :  I even had people write to me to fix this today, that you guys are not seeing this is a huge issue like it is, shows where your priorities are. 

785 :  I know that also see people having this issues daily and even he has it, it's funny you guys dont think that is a huge problem.. 

786 :  As I stated, there is not enough time to duplicate all CI builds and to fix all the bugs that would get uncovered from there. 

787 :  The tool should serve the purpose, not the other way around! 

788 :  If you decide to solve it what's the point of saying in the middle okay now it's too difficult"." 

789 :  you should already know that things that *appear* trivial can, in fact, turn out to be intractable, and being combative about that helps no one. 

790 :  Did you a) (only) respond to the issue, or did you b) choose to unnecessarily attack my experience? 

791 :  So feels like it is the other way around to me. ‚ 

792 :  your attitude here makes my day measurably worse. 

793 :  I've asked you to do this once already and am not going to ask a third time - if you continue to be combative to people just trying to help, we'll be asking you to discontinue your engagement on the issue tracker. 

794 :  Your comment is insulting and more than useless 

795 :  bitch needs a slap 

796 :  Keep in mind that violations of the code of conduct can result in being banned. 

797 :  I always try to remind participants that we are *all* striving to make TypeScript better - but if you want to participate, the only way to do so is with respect. 

798 :  We can't tolerate abrasive language or tone on this issue tracker, and it has clearly become a problem here, so I'm closing the thread. 

799 :  If you cannot do that, we cannot allow you to engage on the issue tracker. 

800 :  I'm fed up the whole framework is filled with this crap. 

801 :  Why you even do double way binding if works half the needed cases? 

802 :  Don't even make a framework at this point 

803 :  It has no fucking sense. 

804 :  If the customer didn't specifically asked for angular I would have thrown this piece of trash in the toilet long time ago 

805 :  Thumbs down my ass, it's reality  that smacks your face 

806 :  Spoiler: no template i have no time to waste 

807 :  Instead of thumbing down like twitter and facebook kids, show me I'm wrong ¥‡ 

808 :  thumbs down don't bother me, take some relief on your real life frustration and let them rain down ’¯ 

809 :  Thats the damn problem 

810 :  Hundreds of issues at day you say. A stable and mature and professional product after all these years shouldnt. 

811 :  Instead it leaves you clueless with these kind of things and stupid documentation which is a copy paste from semi working code samples from tour of heroes which in some case alre also wrong and with errors in it. 

812 :  Yeah don't cry in silence and show us your strong arguments against my point 

813 :  This long reply is to show that I'm not just an angry fool, lot of people is fed up with it and it actually is an half baked crippled tool 

814 :  But there is an even more FUNNY thing. I AM ACTUALLY ALREADY USING setValue even before writing this post!!! 

815 :  At some point you have to trust engine contributors to know what bugs are. 

816 :  Here, renamed, be happy. 

817 :  This is getting silly already. No way it makes any sense. 

818 :  How is this offtopic? Please stop bringing politics into development world. That's just mindblowingly silly. 

819 :  That is hilarious. 

820 :  What is the next requirement OpenJS will ask for? To remove the **test** directory to avoid similarity with **test**icles? 

821 :  I'm not understanding why tasks could be included dynamically, but a playbook wouldn't be. 

822 :  I need to conditionally import a playbook, which isn't possible.  The keyword I'm missing is include_playbook" which would allow a "when" to apply to it." 

823 :  Of course we do. 

824 :  Oh, so you monitor them, but completely ignore them. Much better. 

825 :  You are making toxic and unhelpful statements. 

826 :  If you want to continue to make mean and unhelpful assumptions and remarks, go ahead, but then we can just close down this whole thread as well. 

827 :  Sarcasm and profanity will not help you get your issues resolved. 

828 :  I find it extremely frustrating using terminal as a REPL. 

829 :  I think it's quite stubborn to say you know what your users want. 

830 :  TBH, you really can't force down the throat of what tastes bland. 

831 :  If you don't like the new window, that's fine. 

832 :  If you don't want to give feedback on the new idea, because you just want us to fix the original REPL, that's fine too. 

833 :  Actually, please don't fix it. I am not paying you. And you believe you have the best idea, and that my request is too much. 

834 :  No, I don't think spending some personal time investigating a problem you have with a software you got from me for free is rude"." 

835 :  I've pointed out your mistake and you are perfectly capable of spotting the difference between the original configuration that was working and you've commented out and the one you've changed and that don't. 

836 :  Too bad that you do not consider this rude 

837 :  you do not care. 

838 :  it just not helpful to make false statements like: 'works for me' and 'you messed up writers' because you did not bother to run the repro-case following very simple instructions. 

839 :  If I state that your sample works for me", it of course means that I did bother running it on my side and didn't get to reproduce the issue you're mentioning." 

840 :  Perhaps the Linux project should change its name as they've conflicted with a city in Hawaii which existed long before. 

841 :  I feel like there's much less confusion between a city in Hawaii and a multi platform app framework both called Maui than a multi platform app framework and a multi platform app framework both called Maui. 

842 :  So you think of a Hawaian city when reading Maui", but not when reading "MAUI"? Really?" 

843 :  You find the comparison between a city in Hawaii and MauiKit ridiculous just like I find your comparison between an the Maui abbreviation and MauiKit ridiculous 

844 :  So yeah, there's an obvious naming clash here 

845 :  How is having two product with the same name and same basic scope (multi platform framework) a non issue? 

846 :  this project you're fighting for so passionately, doesn't have as many stars as I have thumbs down for telling you that you'e being ridiculous 

847 :  That's because GitHub stars are not a currency in which you measure a project that is not even developed on GitHub. 

848 :  I don't think they took into account either confusion with the Linux project" *nor with the Hawaiian island*." 

849 :  By the way, is it seriously necessary to mention that when there's an obvious name conflict with some other free software project in the exactly same domain (UI toolkit)? 

850 :  get over this Linux vs. Windows" mantra you still seem to follow." 

851 :  yes, this was half sarcasm, half serious comment. I think you can figure out which half's which. 

852 :  And this is not even a confusing _similarity_. We are talking about a multi platform framework called MAUI, and a multi platform framework called MAUI. 

853 :  You could've at least googled the name you were giving to your product before doing so, or choose one that's used from a product with a different scope. 

854 :  so you like this cute little side project... but let's be honest here when it comes to being a serious project it's not one. 

855 :  Your attitude is as if Microsoft is being some big evil corporation. 

856 :  Ok let's look at kde... there are 10 open issues... are you seriously going to tell me that a serious cross platform framework has 10 open issues... that's not realistic in any shape way or form. So again your complaints are just being ridiculous. 

857 :  The reality is I highly doubt anybody heard of MauiKit, and frankly nobody cares. 

858 :  Are you an _official_ Microsoft or Xamarin representative, and if so, is this the official position of your company?. 

859 :  What do you expect, providing some real arguments against nonsense or offending replies like you're all mad" or "it's the others' fault, they need to rename" (aka "we are Microsoft (related), we are bigger, you need to comply" or, my favorite, "same name is not a problem at all", pretending that confusion was not an issue..." 

860 :  great strategy, being offending once you run out of arguments! 

861 :  How can you seriously accuse others of like, thinking in this old it's a big evil company" way (which nobody really has), while yourself being extremely off-putting towards the open-source community? It makes no sense..." 

862 :  How can you seriously accuse others of like, thinking in this old it's a big evil company" way (which nobody really has), while yourself being extremely off-putting towards the open-source community? It makes no sense..." 

863 :  You have *zero* reason to belittle this or _any_ other open-source project. 

864 :  Imagine trying to put up a faÃ§ade with mslinux, then turning stuff into a dick size competition with repo stars and other stats because you know you messed up and don't want to admit it lmfao 

865 :  you want to see what a real Open Source application framework looks like I suggest you start taking notes. 

866 :  It is unethical, you are don't have any arguments? 

867 :  I don't know how you can question the seriousness of one of the biggest communities that drive open source principles many years before Microsoft fell in love with open source. 

868 :  So a project has value based on open issues? 

869 :  There appear to be more passive-aggressive comments towards another project in this thread from you alone than there are from all other people towards this .NET repository. 

870 :  Unless you _actually_ work for the companies involved, your opinion is probably negligible here. 

871 :  I'm surprised no one complained about Microsoft's use of the name `core` 

872 :  What I do see is a bunch of people who want to complain but probably never have used Xamarin and probably never will use Maui regardless of what it's called. 

873 :  Beautiful! You steal name and say that it's OK! Good position! 

874 :  ... not sure if you expect us all to email you now, but please be prepared... 

875 :  Isn't that the exact opposite thing that any sane person would do? 

876 :  Its OK to be passionate but attacking another open source project for any reason is not okay. 

877 :  This is not the kind of community we want to have and such behavior will not be tolerated. 

878 :  Using sexual abusive language is not the way to express your opinion. 

879 :  Your assumption about that it's self-descriptiveness is only _partially_ correct when you refer to several ppl you mentioned. 

880 :  I myself try avoiding to assume that other people see and understand things exactly the same way as me, because every individual has their own unique experience. That said I encourage you to not make such assumptions here. 

881 :  You give false impression to others. 

882 :  Brian should argue his case from a position of hands on, mature knowledge rather than having us collect that for him and demanding his proposal be accepted unmodified and that none of us is in a better position than to test and evaluate the suitability of including the proposal of porting `canonicalize` unmodified into the go standard library for Windows than he himself and the company he works for. 

883 :  It's fairly frustrating to see my words being repeatedly 

884 :  You're incorrect 

885 :  I don't appreciate trying to have the last word on this argument after I told you I don't wish to debate it. 

886 :  Not only is your comment extremely insulting to the work my team is doing, you keep going and rambling we caAaAn't truUust theEem theEey're the deviIil in disguiIise"." 

887 :  I find this behavior ridiculous, entitled, and generally not up to the standard our community should strive for. 

888 :  Everyone who disagrees with me doesn't know what they are talking about"" 

889 :  Nice, the only notable contribution you've ever made anywhere on Github is making sure everyone at Google knows you're a racist. 

890 :  BlackLivesMatter is not meant to be a racist statement, except you see it like this. 

891 :  So you need fix it in you county, and do not force your problems to all world! 

892 :  Anyway this issue will be closed without an answer since Google doesn't care about people but sticking to their narrative. 

893 :  Everyone here will be called a white supremacist antiblack antiasian antilgtbteq1324 and risking to be banned from the repo. 

894 :  Welcome to 1984. 

895 :  Nothing more cringey than tech framework sites posting about politics, even if you agree with the sentiment. 

896 :  You know what, the white A" in the Angular logo is all of a sudden making me feel uncomfortable...maybe even a little oppressed. Hmm, could the Angular team be racists??? Maybe we should make a separate issue to change the color to black." 

897 :  Just noticed the #BlackLivesMatter banner on the home page for the first time...what a joke. 

898 :  Anyone have a list of other political movements endorsed by the Angular site? 

899 :  What's racist about it? Also don't shame others based on their skills and development experience. That's against the code of conduct. 

900 :  All lives matter" isn't racist either, yet apparently saying that makes you a white supremacist or something." 

901 :  People can express their opinions but the mods are just gonna lock it away cause y'all can't behave" and "the discussion is getting out of hand and is not productive anymore"" 

902 :  Funny how the first comment is being sarcastic about [the master branch] 

903 :  I guess I'll give up my Master's degree to show solidarity. 

904 :  why is it on the front-page of Angular and **what is the criteria** which determines what gets on the front page. **Who decides what's important enough?** 

905 :  If you're so sure that it's such a good idea, why do you have to act so quick about locking it so as not to give people a chance to give their opinion on the matter? 

906 :  But it just feels less and less a framework and more and more a political board. 

907 :  Why are you using this platform for displaying your political agenda. You have other platforms to do that. No one wants this here. 

908 :  This crap has gotten way out of control, give em an inch and they'll try to take a mile. 

909 :  Enough is enough already, rather than people getting offended by a word that is not offensive in this context, 

910 :  I can't believe the insanity that's going on. 

911 :  That's the context and the only context. 

912 :  I guess my `Masters Degree` now has to renamed to `Main Degree` as well.. 

913 :  Simply stupid. 

914 :  Stupid, like all this progressive shit destroying everything it touches. 

915 :  Simply stupid. There's no other way to put it. Stupid, like all this progressive shit destroying everything it touches. 

916 :  I recommend you finding another tool where you can work with easily without headache yourself with this particular one. This is what I did myself. 

917 :  You have missed some quotes around a string. 

918 :  I am a scikit-learn newbie and have just have spent a frustrating time going thought the docs, and I can't find anywhere how to read my own data (and not a prepared toy dataset), and what the python format of data is. 

919 :  I don't know whether you are one of scikit-learn staff or not, but I need to say that your way of talking is harming both scikit-learn staff and users (us) 

920 :  you seem quite misinformed about what is scikit-learn, how it works, and how the project is developed. 

921 :  it's literally your job. or you are here just to spam random stuff till people get pissed off and leave? 

922 :  your comments look absolutely random with quite zero connection to the reality. either a bot or ... very unintelligent person. which is fine by me as long as you keep a distance from me. 

923 :  so, if you don't know a solution, DO NOT POST ANY COMMENTS. 

924 :  and again  if you don't know a solution, DO NOT POST ANY COMMENTS. 

925 :  bot or something? your comments look absolutely random with quite zero connection to the reality. either a bot or ... very unintelligent person. which is fine by me as long as you keep a distance from me. 

926 :  There is no need for personal insults or caps. 

927 :  i dint yet started the insults. its called personal observation. look it up. 

928 :  what consoles and what modes? (did you actually read the ''To Reproduce'' ????? i have the feeling you didnt) 

929 :  now i have the feeling you didn't read anything at all. 

930 :  or you just assume that if it works for you work for absolutely everyone? 

931 :  you have not actually commented here regarding the problem or the intention to fix it. 

932 :  A bit of research can help you get the info you need in order to be able to perform the necessary tests to confirm/deny your theory so you can start acting on knowledge. 

933 :  Seeing this issue as well, its very annoying. 

934 :  Now: it seems like the discussion here _has_ reached its terminus, so there isnt value in leaving it unlocked for angry people to get their digs in. 

935 :  while I fully understand your reasoning, this is detrimental to people learning how to use Ansible. 

936 :  AT LEAST remove the banner for people that are not in the US. 

937 :  No, it got locked because people disagree with your ignorant stance. 

938 :  I will not participate in a dictatorship as you're too dumb on the matter to be my leader. 

939 :  You guys suck at everything! 

940 :  WTF Microsoft! 

941 :  Microsoft should grow turnips instead of writing software! 

942 :  I would be tempted to blame legalization for this kind of mishap, but you guys have always sucked at software! 

943 :  Windows sucks and now you even made .NET, your crown jewels, suck! 

944 :  This wasted several hours of my time trying to work through the suggested troubleshooting tips 

945 :  Can't you guys get anything done without turning it into a nightmare? 

946 :  Everything you guys put your hands on sucks! 

947 :  Relax and take your medication. 

948 :  So I guess I need to be smoking the same grass you're smoking in order to medicate my way out of seeing Microsoft's mediocrity?  No thanks! 

949 :  Because we can undo it" is not a good reason to present bad statistics." 

950 :  So as long as everyone reads through at least the first 39 pages of the Unicode standard then there shouldn't be any problem. 

951 :  Meanwhile, you've provided zero evidence to support your claim, which is based solely on your personal experience. 

952 :  It's no wonder that even Google's own engineers could care less about the company's style guides. 

953 :  And here I'd thought that Google workers were above mansplaining.  Stupid me 

954 :  It's a very convenient way of saying that the bug I had in my code was a bug with my design rather than the .Net Native compiler even though my code did/should work in any given .Net runtime context, but .Net Native is special, thus requiring special design considerations. 

955 :  before you close this issue you will have to adjust where you point the finger. 

956 :  The problem isn't with MessagePack, according to @MichalStrehovsky the problem is your design choice since you, being on the inside of Microsoft, have an even better understanding of the way the .Net Native compiler works. 

957 :  It may be a PITA to have .Net Native issues surfaced this way. 

958 :  Both the comment you make and the way initiated the closure of this issue was disingenuous. 

959 :  Just say so and stop pretending that any of the .Net Native compiler problems will actually be addressed. 

960 :  A year went by on the gRPC issue.  A year with no resolution!  I'd even be ok with a form of admission and a statement along the lines that we need to resolve these issues ourselves.   At least that way, time wouldn't be wasted on false expectations. 

961 :  ou're wasting a lot of our time slandering our competence 

962 :  You can censor me if you like. 

963 :  you keep bringing it back to advocating for breaking compatibility in the language design as if this was the same level of implication. 

964 :  I'm tired of this bikeshedding. I tried to advocate for keeping this issue focused on the actual bug that can be fixed (syntax highlighting) 

965 :  Seems more like Bram enjoys taking all the credit. 

966 :  It literally takes less than 30 minutes to learn git. That's no excuse. 

967 :  No, I don't understand.  Any software developer doing things exactly the same as 10 years ago is a **bad** software developer, let alone 30 years ago. 

968 :  To think that a new idea is better than an old one simply because it is new is foolish. 

969 :  When looking for information about Vim, the place to look is always the built-in help. Not Google, not the manpages, not the github metadata, just the help. In this case: :help credits 

970 :  So, instead of ranting here, maybe you should try to find the cause of the problem and/or open a PR that fixes this kind of issue, if necessary. 

971 :  This seems unnecessarily hostile, especially given that, in your own words, - I shouldn't complain about software I had nothing to pay for"" 

972 :  Have you considered simply reporting the issue, without any of the assholery? 

973 :  If you would like to re-open another GitHub issue calmly describing your problem with less vitriol and toxicity, I will gladly add it to my next release milestone, I'll add a test case for the situation, and I'll forget that this exchange happened. 

974 :  Sorry to say, that I am totally pissed off from this worst programmed piece of software/plugin I have ever seen. 

975 :  You actually need to keep hearing our feedback, every one of us. 

976 :  you should be working to find the screams because it takes tons of effort for us to get the screams close to you. 

977 :  you should want to know about all of these peoples feedback, especially when its them screaming in paper cut agony. 

978 :  So, let's put it straight, with the largest, boldest letters: **THIS IS NOT A FLUTTER ISSUE, There is no Flutter solution or workaround and never will be.** 

979 :  don't be stupid, it's a bug 

980 :  Your belief that you're doing anyone a favor by varying from the expected command line tool behavior, you should turn in your commit per.issions and get a job in management where you don't have access to break things AGAIN. 

981 :  By not doing what the command line tools do, you are varying from the expected behavior and breaking convention. THIS IS WRONG. 

982 :  Save your energy. Lex has rejected this again and again. 

983 :  Put your overlays as extra quads into your item model, he says. 

984 :  Threatening to coremods shit because you haven't spent 10 mins looking into other solutions is not the way to get things added to forge. 

985 :  It's pretty useless to complain about someone not looking without pointing them in the right direction. 

986 :  It's excruciatingly abrasive and dickish and impedes fostering a community that actually wants to contribute to a project. 

987 :  Going off on someone because you assume they haven't searched for other solutions makes you look like a dick. 

988 :  I don't care if you consider my response dickish, your initial post was. 

989 :  i'm sick of being threatened by people and coremods. 

990 :  I would have loved to work with you, but since you were not willing to accept any recommendations, I am closing this and we will do any remaining work in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/48058. 

991 :  WTF guys, you can't make built version of app? 

992 :  so to use it i need to download huge amounts of not needed data and applications? That not how the Linux works. 

993 :  And also polite mean to make installation for users, and not throwing in their faces some code and say do whatever you want with it"." 

994 :  t's really not that hard to understand... 

995 :  Why don't you develop your own terminal instead of asking like you are the CEO of Microsoft? 

996 :  Some people shouldn't act like a ass just because they think different. 

997 :  I agree that @creotiv should not act like an ass 

998 :  I didn't mean that but whatever floats your boat man. ƒ 

999 :  Where's your binaries?  Just because it's early and incomplete" (just like this code on this repo is) shouldn't be an excuse." 

1000 :  3 month to make an installer for an app)) that's nice) 

1001 :  Look, 24h later, a valid tiny patch is still not merged and we'd need to discuss" why shippable failed on its improvement, not even on the patch itself." 

1002 :  I can submit the bug elsewhere but do you really mean to suggest that I need to know about HPLIP and cups-filters to understand why three different tools process the options I've set (using your software) in three different ways? 

1003 :  Who takes responsibility when other projects don't know how to interface correctly with your software? 

1004 :  Are you ever grateful to receive bug reports about your project? 

1005 :  You don't think any of your documentation needs to be fixed? 

1006 :  So cups-pdf is HP's problem too? Is there any Linux software you can name that interfaces with CUPS correctly? 

1007 :  Is there any Linux software you can name that interfaces with CUPS correctly? 

1008 :  It would help to have an answer to this question, relating to the configuration of face-up printers 

1009 :  Please look at this, because @raver119 is still angry I said C wasn't a good language. 

1010 :  I don't even remember who you are. 

1011 :  That's a bit of surprising statement. 

1012 :  P.s. sorry. Just too many people around. 

1013 :  Keep it professional or I won't hesitate to ban you from interacting with this repository. 

1014 :  Just seems pointless to continue supporting something that uses so much developer time. 

1015 :  You can do that, but don't blame the software then. 

1016 :  You still try to push Salt to adhere to OMV data format, while common sense says it should be otherwise. 

1017 :  i alreeady said it was kneejerk impulse, so you eems to be crashing through door wide open. 

1018 :  You blaze of ego is called for. 

1019 :  Yesterday i spent hours looking into Salt code and patching it along your suggestions. 

1020 :  First i took your suggestions as correct and thought through. And just followed them. An then had to undo it all. 

1021 :  Now you imply it was your time wasted not mine. 

1022 :  you refused to help me doing it. 

1023 :  You made me look into Linux kernel i am not familiar with, at the same time you are not very willing to point me to specific OMV code and Salt commands you are familiar with. 

1024 :  you are funny :) 

1025 :  you can learn a bit about semantics, grammar and the meanings of words - essentialy about language and usage :)  can you tell me who was here offended ? 

1026 :  when we have storage OOM gradle doesn't sygnalize that, instead proper info we have a bullshit :) 

1027 :  still some daemon shit WTF ??? 

1028 :  Flutter team, PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE PROPERLY! 

1029 :  It looks like no one from Flutter team cares about the issue. 

1030 :  I'm sorry but I have to be this guy... The fact is that you left this repository unanswered for two plain month. 

1031 :  you MUST understant that without repo's activity people will not be interested in SUI anymore, and you'll try to find funds for a dead project... 

1032 :  I am BEGGING @levithomason, @jlukic, or any other project owner to PLEASE add at least two more trusted owners or managers with the power to add more committers and maintainers so badly needed. 

1033 :  A 10 second look would of shown you that. 

1034 :  do not readd links in which I have removed, do it again and you'll be blocked. 

1035 :  I have instructed you on two paths on how to achieve your goal now. 

1036 :  I don't appreciate you basically calling me an idiot in all caps when you didn't bother to even consider that maybe I had a good reason for doing it the way I did. 

1037 :  Except, you don't have a good reason, if you would of worked with anyone in the community to figure things out before resorting to hacking things with a coremod then we would be having a different conversation. 

1038 :  Fuck you flutter, if macos adds PATH, it just wont join, go to hell, youre so ugly, Google is so big, will the script be configured to die? 

1039 :  This is why Linux products are the way they are, and why no one had ever heard of KDE MAUI until now -- you lot just argue about inane stuff instead of getting work done. 

1040 :  Are you a lawyer? Maybe you should check with one before you potentially commit business libel. 

1041 :  Yes, I am opening a new one because fuck you Microsoft. 

1042 :  You are merely trying to cast a shadow on other, truly open source projects. 

1043 :  why did you close this? 

1044 :  The maintainers of the project are using a dependency that is buggy, they should take care of this 

1045 :  That's your responsibility to take care of things that don't work as expected in the dependencies of your project. 

1046 :  You are advertising syntax highlighting, you are supposed to deliver! 

1047 :  And if you don't, you are supposed to take care of whatever is needed to have your product work as expected 

1048 :  We're not contractually obligated to work on every bug and answer every question, seeing as we simply don't have enough resources. 

1049 :  (I) really love this ability to minimize comments on GitHub.. :sparkles: 

1050 :  You got us. It's a joke. 

1051 :  I mean cmon guys, is this a joke? 

1052 :  It is ridiculously funny not having a password lock for the most sensible information inside the phone that leads to basically unlocking all of your secure accounts. 

1053 :  I mean cmon guys, is this a joke? 2FA without a feature to lock the screen from people? 

1054 :  Your tone is derogatory. 

1055 :  This is the incorrect approach based upon your issue. 

1056 :  You got my support on this @filmgirl. 

1057 :  rooting for you @filmgirl ‰ 

1058 :  11/10, want to see this happen! ’œ 

1059 :  Knowing that this is possible my life will not be the same without it 

1060 :  I can't believe it hasn't already been implemented, this is a must have feature. 

1061 :  This needs a kickstarter campaign 

1062 :  How have I been using Terminal without this feature for so long? I'm using plain old terminal until we have it! 

1063 :  This explains a lot and why microsoft made ton of bad decisions recently, maybe the people at the top are delusional? 

1064 :  This is really offending for people that are suffering for global warming and desertfication areas. 

1065 :  Also is that a natural snow icon or a fake snow icon? 

1066 :  Please think about how much water Is wasted to create artificial snow just for games 

1067 :  It is really offending me because I am very snow sensitive and get hurt by snowflakes when it is snowing. 

1068 :  If I see that on the VS code I feel physically hurt. 

1069 :  On the other hand snowflake is the best symbol for spineless corporations bowing down to any random activist complain. 

1070 :  Also there was some recent effort to associate snowflake and Santa with its red hat to drug consumption so please don't talk about Its red hat and snow symbol in the same thread. :smile_cat: 

1071 :  I am with you guys- the one **TROLL** that offended many, many people got his wish fulfilled. Only ONE person wanted this ridiculous change and you are just ignoring so many requests to bring back what was deleted. Shame on you, shame. 

1072 :  You're not my dad, I can use everything I like / dislike! 

1073 :  Please stop offended me! You're not my dad, I can use everything I like / dislike! 

1074 :  I'd be really  grateful if that the correct reaction will be delivered like the other one, snowflakes do hurt and sting in the eyes, I won't be able to sleep if I see all day this hurtful symbol of pain and climate oppression in my IDE. 

1075 :  Some guy in Microsoft HQ is sweating right now.  Although this is 100% deserved. 

1076 :  His name is **Christian**, that must be a troll account, too good to be true :D 

1077 :  I'm from New Zealand, and in the Southern Hemisphere, it's not cold, but hot during the holiday season. I suggest you geo-locate the user's position and prompt them for the icon of their choice, e.g. snow, ice, fire, sun shine. 

1078 :  Every Christian should be renamed immediately to eliminate possible offence. 

1079 :  This is a serious discussion about the terror that is snow flakes and how it terrorises a lot of people everyday, even more now with the new VS Code update. 

1080 :  I would also like to point out that snow(flake) is _white_ and is commonly used as a white supremacy symbol to oppress and marginalize whole ethnicities, which due to systemic geographic discrimination couldn't historically experience, first-hand, full range of weather phenomena. 

1081 :  Winter is one good buff against invaders in Russia. Praise the winter! Let it snow! 

1082 :  The Snow Flake on vscode insiders and pushing it as a cozy"/"wintery" thing is very offensive to me." 

1083 :  This isn't just me either, think about the people who cannot even get snow, think about how you're making them feel, making them see what they cannot get, although personally I don't understand that. Snow is terrifying. 

1084 :  Oh no, I just mentioned way too many forbidden things, so this is getting removed too. Along with this thread. And me. And you. 

1085 :  We must remove the hat, all mentions of the hat, all mentions of removing the mentions of the hat and so on, just to be sure. 

1086 :  That's way too rational, a guy was extremely offended, please have some consideration! 

1087 :  The removing of the Santa hat and catering to vocal minority of sjw idiots is very offensive to me. 

1088 :  If Santa is a religious figure, then so is the Grinch, 

1089 :  It's so sad that people are so sensitive in the world we live in today that this sort of thing is even worth discussion.. 

1090 :  My understanding is that he was actually upset of the pagan origins :man_shrugging: 

1091 :  It was removed all because of this one guy: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/87268 and he prob think that what he did is funny. 

1092 :  Got as far as to feel the joy of my parents being alive, but then a snowflake got in the way and I got offended. 

1093 :  In addition, it reminds me of black people lurking around. 

1094 :  Microsoft scares me by forcing people to use this theme. 

1095 :  Please don't laugh. This is a serious issue for me. I want to force removal of the feature for everyone, because it hurts my feelings. And no, don't make a toggle for it. It would remind me that a death is still there, but not visible. 

1096 :  I don't know if it makes any difference, but I'm a black Jew living in Uganda. 

1097 :  To avoid being offended, please use the transparent perspicuous pellucid theme. 

1098 :  Did you just say trans-parent? But it's ok, my conservative belifs can and even should be offended. 

1099 :  PC?! What if I'm a mac-user?! 

1100 :  Dark theme is basically a blackface of white editors. 

1101 :  VS Code dark theme reminds me of this situation, so please remove it immediately, because for me dark theme = death. 

1102 :  User Christian-Schiffer that created such awful request offended many users and Microsoft just standing there like nothing happened. 

1103 :  I demand syntax highlighting be removed, as it reminds me of the other night when I puked out the three plates of ravioli I'd eaten. It is very offensive to me and instantly brings back memories of a very bad stomachache. 

1104 :  I find the V" in "VS Code" offensive. It represents two fingers being held up in an obscene gesture and could be read as "F*ck You"." 

1105 :  This censorship is literally a new holocaust! 

1106 :  I'm extremely offended by the fact that because of religious beliefs @Mikotochan 's only life pleasure has been taken away. 

1107 :  You deserve an award for skyrocketting the level of drama of this topic  – ! 

1108 :  One time a random person told me to œgit good and since then, œgit is extremely offensive to me. 

1109 :  Please remove Python compatibility I'm scared of snakes. 

1110 :  It's funny and sad at the same time that one selfish issue can cause loss of hundrets of man-days (people-days?) across globe. 

1111 :  I enjoy reading drama, please don't take my only pleasure in life away. 

1112 :  I think it is necessary to **remove** this Terminal" word, as it can really offend someone's feelings in some country at some time." 

1113 :  Additionally Terminal" has cost millions of Jews their lives over the centuries because the word "terminal" could also mean ["Extermination Camp"]" 

1114 :  Terminal" might also remind someone about a terminal illness they are facing" 

1115 :  Oh my god! Man! It's something that I wish for the years! Christmas miracle literally exists! 

1116 :  people who thumb down the santa have never received a present from him, naughty boys 

1117 :  it seems like kernel trauma, it has befriended santa and now microsoft crushed its dreams 

1118 :  Please add also an ultra-offensive debugger that shitstorms you on every error 

1119 :  I also can't focus on my work since then, please let me be productive again 

1120 :  Please make it your top priority to bring Santa hat back. 

1121 :  Coding productivity has decreased enormously since the removal of the Santa hat. 

1122 :  Assuming he wasn't just trolling: if one gets butthurt and triggered over an emoji or icon, then the internet is not really the place where one should hang around. 

1123 :  Pandering to icon haters seems to be high on Microsoft's list instead of handling actual bug fixes or feature requests. 

1124 :  Are you happy @Christian-Schiffer? Your behaviour offence a lot of people around the world. 

1125 :  I think you must apologize to these people and @egamma must do it too. 

1126 :  Get back the Santa icon you morons 

1127 :  How much of a brain do you have to delete that icon as a result of hate speech of a single idiot? 

1128 :  XDDDDD careful. microsoft now owns github too and they also take direct orders from jerusalem. your account will be vanished in no time. their petty feelings are way above yours so hush now 

1129 :  This Santa Hat situation is unacceptable. This is outrageous and humiliating. 

1130 :  We demand apologies from @microsoft and that the Hat be back! 

1131 :  Im just sickk of having to go through thousnads of tutorials, forums, chats, emails and so on every time Unity updates, or the HoloToolkit or the MRDL or visual studio... It is just SUPER UNSTABLE and a serious pain in the *** to do anything. 

1132 :  This is the first time I've heard from you, so **let's open a new issue and try to figure out what's going on**. 

1133 :  I am dead serious, WHEN??? You are not adding/doing anything useful to it, nothing beneficial for the end user. 

1134 :  This conversation is over. 

1135 :  why the hell did you haphazardly change the initial value of properties in this commit??? 

1136 :  why the hell you break my code programmed against gradle 4.10 in the **very first** release after that??? 

1137 :  i can't believe you guys, this is completely irresponsible. and don't tell me you needed to do this to support property conventions, you didn't. 

1138 :  again, I insist my way to fix this problem, which is no doubt the most simple and efficient approach to this problem. 

1139 :  I don't care about which PR will be merged finally, but I do care about the most reasonable solution for this problem. 

1140 :  This isn't how we have technical disagreements. No amount of technical correctness can make up for treating other people poorly, please don't repeat that behavior. 

1141 :  I don't know why you're so hysterical about which PR should be merged, and what I want to clarify here is that obviously I found this problem before you, and I have not even found the existence of golang/net@08b3837 until @fisherxu mentioned it in my PR, that why I push a new commit using http2.ConfigureTransports today and open this [PR](https://github.com/golang/net/pull/84) trying to fix the problem before. 

1142 :  And besides I didn't have any reference on your PR as I have not even noticed you before. 

1143 :  you should learn how to use Git with clear&clean commit history. 

1144 :  You have disagreement but no reason. That's personal. 

1145 :  You are so unbelievably arrogant that I don't want to waste my time arguing with you. 

1146 :  No amount of technical correctness can make up for treating other people poorly 

1147 :  that's not a good excuse for doing nothing, not everybody like you github employees (I heard most atom developers are ?) has a macbook for each, and there are many ones still using old computers, ... 

1148 :  You still haven't addressed my concern with this Issue, @crquan, namely that there isn't a method of determining if Atom is beyond the size of an editor should be"." 

1149 :  Is 207MB too big? Is 200MB? Is 10MB? Please give an example of what size is small enough" and what size "too big" and, most importantly, why." 

1150 :  A bug is nearly worthless if it cannot ever be fixed. And without a clearly defined goal, this bug cannot be fixed. 

1151 :  want to speak directly, the words very cheap to buy a USB" seems really ridiculous." 

1152 :  That make no sense, why you make efforts to a open source, because you love it. when you love it, why not keep it the best.

-----
Original test dataset:

TEXT
1 :  Can you give indications on where the changes should happen and other indications? 

2 :  I am a bit lost in the source code 

3 :  My sincere apologies if I missed something. 

4 :  If I sound hostile, it because I am kindly sharing the user hostility you're unleashing on developers trying to get work done. 

5 :  I don't know anything about gclient or gyp, and I didn't see any documentation in the repo to lead me in the right direction (except the README, which tells me I should be looking in tools/). 

6 :  I'm afraid that without guidance/help I won't be able to move far with the port. 

7 :  I'm also having huge issues with building NSPR similarly to what was reported in comment #&#173,7 over an year ago. 

8 :  I would like to help .. just don't think I have the needed skills. 

9 :  Unfortunately since then work has been busy which left no time for further dart work. 

10 :  It's quite sad that not all of the interested parties were invited to the table. 

11 :  I understand your frustration at the delay in getting this in. 

12 :  It is possible that moving the files to third_party is not ideal but it does provide us a clean separation of the hosts that the Dart team ships periodically as install ready binaries in a SDK vs other hosts. 

13 :  If you have other ideas on how we can maintain this separation I am willing to listen. 

14 :  I had plans to make a proper port (with separate files and not patches on the linux ones) but after seeing how the Dart team treated the BSD ports efforts and specially Mulander's work ... I really got disappointed and lost all interest in Dart! 

15 :  I've likewise abandoned Dart because I see nothing in the Dart project to give me confidence that it will be ported. 

16 :  I'm willing to give it another look if things change, but I can't use something if it doesn't support the systems I deploy on. 

17 :  This would really help modularizing our code 

18 :  The lack of communication on one of, if not the most requested feature of the last 3-4 years is not something to appreciate. 

19 :  They decided to implement it which is great news, crass comments like these do not help anyone. 

20 :  apologise if you felt somehow attacked by my comment. 

21 :  Lose more games than the Jets and act like you are a team full of Tom Bradys. 

22 :  It would be great if aside from the current way of building widgets you could add JSX like capabilities. 

23 :  Sorry if I sound defensive or aggressive. :-) 

24 :  don't take my argumentative tone as dismissive, I'm very interested in your input here. 

25 :  Stop nit-picking things that are not fully specified. 

26 :  Make Flutter look familiar to React developers and you have a chance of attracting a bunch of new users to Flutter. 

27 :  Wow, could have written a blog post xD 

28 :  The point being, we haven't made any decisions yet, and are very open to learning what needs to be done based on all these discussions and experiments. 

29 :  That I appreciate and I read all your 'long writings', answering everything: no way, but when I answer properly you don't understand my answer and concludes that I am being dismissive. 

30 :  And if, by chance, he was being sincere, then I apologize for my snideness 

31 :  We are very interested to better understand your scenarios where WCF server side functionality is required. 

32 :  I have dreamed for years of having WCF across their entire network so that I can finally (!) have reliable transactions and durable services spanning their various generations of Linux and Windows. 

33 :  Having WCF on .Net core is not only desirable, it is essential. 

34 :  We have a strong need to run .NET/WCF on Linux, so please add this to the road map! 

35 :  Stop invest in dead technologies such as WCF and VB.NET, spending tremendous amounts of resources to nowhere, instead of spending for something good. 

36 :  Without WCF we will either have to abandon a lot of the plans or suffer a decrease in productivity.  :-( 

37 :  It's possible you misunderstood the comment. 

38 :  Do I like being productive, absolutely. That means, never using WCF. 

39 :  The code has been already updated, but `7.19.0` did not include this. :( 

40 :  it seems you're a little too caffeinated here : 

41 :  Mike you are a valued JIT contributor 

42 :  I didn't really think about it too much. 

43 :  I didn't really think about it too much.  I was just trying to keep things peaceful here. 

44 :  I honestly believe that his harsh remarks were not intentional. 

45 :  It would be a great loss for the .NET community if you'd stop contributing. 

46 :  If you consider my comment to be negative, just tell me and I'll happily remove it. 

47 :  I did not contribute to get praise, I only contributed for the fun of it. And it stops being fun if I have to deal with nonsense. 

48 :  I can very much relate to that. 

49 :  But we need to be careful that we don't use valuable contributions as a currency to offset disrespectful behavior. 

50 :  Let's just say that it is distasteful. 

51 :  I honestly don't follow any more 

52 :  Sorry to hear that, but what is causing here an issue for you? 

53 :  It supposed to be a discussion so you can ask questions too. 

54 :  Then I quickly deleted it, as I recognized that it was not a helpful reaction and wouldn't help advance the conversation. 

55 :  So excuse me if this is how you felt. 

56 :  Seriously, have I done something to you? 

57 :  I encourage everyone to report this package to npm as its breaking their rules and harmful for npm ecosystem and its attacking users computer. 

58 :  Report it to npm 

59 :  Stop taking money for something that should be free and open. 

60 :  I hope that there is a more reasonable way of asking for funding since this practice will encourage many other projects to do the same and it would be unfortunate for our terminal output logs to look like nascar advertisements after everyone starts doing the same thing, which starts looking like the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). 

61 :  It is sad that so many with such strong opinions have no contributions in the last year outside of this issue. 

62 :  I don't want to have to view advertisements in my CI logs, and I hate what this would mean if other packages started doing this. 

63 :  I didn't mean to suggest that anyone disagreeing was acting as part of a mob. It was meant to apply specifically to those people treating a github issue like it's a place for trolling, nasty comments, etc. My apologies if it came off that way. 

64 :  Just be decent and follow the community's rules. 

65 :  If you are going to rant, go to twitter. 

66 :  Hopefully someone more well versed in this domain can help figure out what is going on. 

67 :  In the end, would be nice if these errors were caught and the users were notified of the GUI of what actions might be needed. 

68 :  Let's all be respectful. 

69 :  Take your foul mouthed trolling to Twitter. 

70 :  Find one that you are satisfied with and use it. 

71 :  Grow up and move along. 

72 :  I hate that these things never actually get fixed or resolved 

73 :  We're having a real problem with this because ESLint ignores the .eslintrc.json file (due to some other bug in ESLint), and it breaks the build. 

74 :  I understand you're upset and this rule is causing problems for you. 

75 :  I've found that it helps to clearly describe the problem I'm encountering and propose some solutions or ask questions to understand the problem space better. 

76 :  I empathize with your frustration 

77 :  Life is too short 

78 :  And the worst part is that I feel helpless to improve the situation. I vote, I campaign, I phone bank, I donate, I protest, I write to officials, I try to inform others... and yet things just keep getting worse and worse. 

79 :  Adding your political beliefs to your licensing is petty. The irony is that this very project is hosted on a resource owned by Microsoft... 

80 :  I'm not as familiar with the react code base (clearly from my comments) but if there's anything you need help on to get this going let me know 

81 :  They haven't commented on any of the related issues and they've been open for months. 

82 :   @_ing from the react team to get some on this? Seems to be quite a lot of interest, but not a single issue on this topic has received a comment from a maintainer in 5 months. 

83 :  Just wanted to chime in and say I strongly feel the same way - it would be at least good to get a hey we won't be considering this"." 

84 :  I know this wasn't your intention 

85 :  I'm really feeling stupid for not being able to figure this one out :( 

86 :  Though I am confident that my analysis is decent enough, much of the code I was referencing was unfamiliar/new to me. 

87 :  I'm not experienced that, but I'll use it for a while to see what happens. 

88 :  If I'm misunderstanding what is being requested here, please let me know. 

89 :  And this whole text could be avoided if you guys simple had said:  yeah that was a bad idea, i will try to put your suggestion in a next changelog or add some tool to convert json/xml then json/plist and any other technology RC lays on"" 

90 :  It would be nice to have shift+insert or Ctrl+shift+insert to have a linux like feeling or ctrl+shift+c and ctrl+shift+v like powershell does 

91 :  I apologise if I've misread any of the code. 

92 :  feel free to point out what I said that was even remotely an attack on *anyone* or an assumption of motivations? 

93 :  I shouldn't have even posted the above, but I couldn't resist throwing my two cents in - sorry! 

94 :  I worry about the racial discrimination have happened in US from long time ago to recent as a human being, while I also insist to regard `blacklist, whitelist, blackbox testing, whitebox testing, master, slave, etc` to be neutral nouns in `IT area` as a software engineer. 

95 :  Indeed, that shows my attitude about racial discrimination and mercy about people who suffer from brutality all around the world. 

96 :  Don't let word game anesthetize us, If everyone pays attention, discrimination will slowly disappear, but if we pretend that it has disappeared now, it may exist forever, The more one tries to hide, the more one is exposed. 

97 :  Whatever your strategic decision for Godot is, it's totally legit. I'm here only to defend bgfx from false statements. 

98 :  Imploring maintainers of an open source software is not going to yield the best results, I think. 

99 :  Don't forget about those instagals! :dancer: 

100 :  stop trying to read the motivations of someone you don't know. 

101 :  I'm happy to keep the discussion going, so don't take this as a negative sign. 

102 :  Follow the steps and put this script tag in the head tag. I'm not sure what else Yandex needs, but this is generally how google adsense works. 

103 :  we want to also be kind in how we request help from the core maintainers of Gatsby. 

104 :  Try to push the cause in Seattle ,) 

105 :  there is a lot of politics behind all these huge software/hardware infrastructures... :-( 

106 :  By soon", do you mean before ______? ( _insert funny sarcasm here_ )." 

107 :  I do hope they are working on a hip backend, not a full fork. That would be sad and only split the working effort. 

108 :  Sorry if the above came out sounding rude, just trying to clarify my position above! 

109 :  This is not Twitter or your Facebook wall... :-) 

110 :  I'm very sad about the abandon of GPU support for macOS. 

111 :  Using GPU acceleration locally on my MacBook Pro or future iMac Pro would be awesome. 

112 :  (yeah, the syntax looks like some sort of incantations or something ,-)) 

113 :  Sorry, nevermind. I made a mess out of it :D. My config was not in order, 

114 :  I'm not a Webpack guru myself 

115 :  So many different solutions, so many different workable options, yet none of them helped me in the past 3 hours getting bootstrap up and running... 

116 :  stop wasting our time. 

117 :  This is the worst framework i have ever seen. 

118 :  I have real project with Angular, and the only thing i get while developing - is the hurting. Tons of hurt i get. 

119 :  when you deal with real big scale project - the hurt is the only thing you get. 

120 :  Go home 

121 :  Let's not make the person who runs a massive open source project almost by himself job harder than it needs to be 

122 :  I read you... I am a Software Engineer, I am that senior level guy you speak of... I have cried out Angular pains in the past. 

123 :  So, sorry I don't have small debate points and I don't blame you for having your point of view. 

124 :  I feel your points. They burn us, too. 

125 :  My hope is that the team gets back to productive boosting features as soon as the dirty plumbing is done. And no need for another major rewrite (Router4?) 

126 :  I hope in the future Angular will become even better and easier to understand. 

127 :  I will step away and unfollow understanding how my mouth often gets me in trouble. 

128 :  make sure that even if using `vh`/`vw` etc, that there's a component for font sizing tied to something else like `px`/`rem`/`em`. 

129 :  I am really sorry if I break any rules. 

130 :  I'm struggling about passive reaction of Flutter team. 

131 :  feel misled because everything I first saw on homepage etc, promised 60 FPS and native performance. I think its bordering on unethical to not make this problem clearly known to new developers. 

132 :  I wish it was paid so we would not get the its free, whatever you get be happy response. 

133 :  At least we would not get a 100 line code commit after 1 year on such a huge issue. 

134 :  So there's nothing concrete that's being done yet? 

135 :  Are there really users that like to keep tabs only on specific parts, like indent? 

136 :  I'd like to voice my displeasure towards two trends going on in Visual Studio editor since VS 2015 

137 :  Finally, I'd appreciate if there was some workaround for this spaces instead of tabs issue, it's driving me nuts. 

138 :  Shouldn't the above satisfy everyone involved? 

139 :  Maybe that is somehow my fault because English is not my primary language and what I wrote is hard to understand, but in all honesty I am not sure what are you arguing for (or against). 

140 :  I am really surprised to hear that something like that cannot be done while still keeping all current options. 

141 :  I'm happy to clarify any of my points. 

142 :  If you'd like another venue to discuss things (perhaps in realtime) I'm also happy to use gitter or discord to continue the discussion :) 

143 :  it may be what you want, but it may be wrong for other users complaining about something similar. 

144 :  I certain see how it can be a bug. 

145 :  Unfortunately though, we've now had this new system a long time, and we are wary about subjecting people to more potential changes in behavior, esp. as it might fix this issue, only to cause problems for others :-/ 

146 :  I don't disagree with that, but there seems to be great resistance to even acknowlege that the behaviour has changed at some point, and that it doesn't seem correct, from a users point of view, that selecting **Always keep TABs** means **Always keep TABs except sometimes they will be changed to spaces** 

147 :  I don't disagree with that, 

148 :  If i've missed any points, i apologize. 

149 :  There's a lot being discussed here, and i likely missed it. 

150 :  I totally get that that can be frustrating. 

151 :  A group of people (that you are not a part of) is having their needs met, while yours are not. 

152 :  However, this really is a space where potential changes risk very bad outcomes for many groups. 

153 :  Again, I'm happy to help clarify any of my statements, or address any points i may have missed. 

154 :  I apologize for being rude 

155 :  At this point I am discouraged to report more because nothing ever seems to get fixed (usually because it's complicated")." 

156 :  I hope you prove me wrong and actually fix this issue, but I won't be holding my breath. 

157 :  I apologize in advance for the offtopic 

158 :  It is, lets say, disappointing that it sounds like Microsoft can't maintain it's code because it is too complex. 

159 :  If you just told me that this shouldn't be addressed because I was a nobody and my opinion wasn't important, I'd be annoyed, certainly, but overall less concerned. 

160 :  change the example 

161 :  give keybox to me now 

162 :  roll your own, pick another technology, or pay the bill. 

163 :  This makes it harder for newcomers to learn aspnet core without the support from the community or microsoft officially 

164 :  If you want to give us feedback on the pricing and explain your situation, this is not the right place to do that. 

165 :  I completely get that the IS devs neeed more money and want to be paid. 

166 :  I'm disappointed that such a basic functionality now requires lots of unplanned work and time. 

167 :  That's really sad. 

168 :  I'm not the guy who can actually judge what you're doing and why 

169 :  somehow like the whole OpenSource-Idea, no? ,) 

170 :  One must learn to pick his fights, so to speak. :) 

171 :  I'm sorry for any distress this experience has caused you. 

172 :  This feature should not be default, this should remain optional until all supported browsers handle it. 

173 :  please correct me if my assumption was incorrect 

174 :  I believe that, in this case, inclusive" means ~"how welcome someone ***feels*** in the angular community." The poster is _telling us_ that, in at least one case, someone doesn't feel like the angular community is inclusive." 

175 :  It also makes clear that, as a community, we do care about how welcome people feel and our issue is not with the _intent_ of the original post (to be more inclusive and thoughtful), but rather the execution. 

176 :  this seems to boil down to what percentage of the community/potential community might interpret `ng` as a slur."" 

177 :  bolster their suggestion by providing more examples or reasons why the interpretation the girl had is actually generally applicable. 

178 :  If I were evaluating this issue, I wouldn't care how many people interpret `ng-repeat` the way I intended, I'm interested in how many people interpret `ng-repeat` the way I *didn't* intend. 

179 :  Because of this, this issue strikes me as providing valuable feedback and I would encourage people to surface similar experiences that they may have had. 

180 :  I'm sorry to hear about your experience and I understand the sensitivity of your concern. 

181 :  Let us take some time to consider your request and respond in a mindful way. 

182 :  It was never our intention 

183 :  we will be very mindful of this problem when creating future APIs 

184 :  We the Angular team, strongly believe in building an inclusive community where everyone feels welcome, and we see how especially ng-repeat could be problematic in certain scenarios. 

185 :  Did you dislike the idea of solving it via a tickable option in the Options window? 

186 :  If the idea of putting it in the Options window is rejected, then I'm trying to brainstorm an alternative solution 

187 :  I personally don't feel like it's worth fixing myself, but i'd be happy to help you with a PR to change if it is something that is affecting you. 

188 :  Two minds being better than one and all that :) 

189 :  If that changes in the future, let me know. 

190 :  My offers of assistance seem to not be welcome 

191 :  It'd be great if a future version of Windows Terminal baked this in by default across all shells - it's really useful to have 

192 :  You can squint and imagine a merged feature that serves all the scenarios. 

193 :  It is very disappointed 

194 :  I've started thinking that Microsoft consider community opinion ... I am very disappointed 

195 :  I think to make right decision for this feature is to create a poll and ask people will they use this feature and would not be it annoying that exist two solutions: static methods and free functions ... 

196 :  And that's also normal that people who against it would like to have more acceptable reasoning or possibility of rethinking 

197 :  when I say stop with ... I really mean that _we're the ones responsible, at the end of the day._ Sorry about that, it sounded bad on a re-read. 

198 :  a few people have been asking me today about pip install 32 bit tensorflow support. 

199 :  Having the same problem here. Would really appreciate a fix 

200 :  then I am going to stop supporting Tensoeflow. 

201 :  We would appreciate a python 32bit fix, some distros install python 32 bit by default and there's no way around it 

202 :  A lot of my clients asking for this too. would appreciate a fix 

203 :  another one just asked me for a fix -_- 

204 :  more people have asked me private for a fix today 

205 :  Don't underestimate how difficult things like this are from a theoretical perspective. 

206 :  Lots of people here manage to be constructive and positive and I'd appreciate your effort in not starting fights with us or other contributors. 

207 :  Go and learn some manners! 

208 :  I've read about observable something, but why would I use the whole framework if I had to use another framework and do my own implementation? 

209 :  If they make fool of me it's not my fault 

210 :  So this means the whole framework is unpolished, untested and lazy coded. 

211 :  clearly you are feeling frustrated and angry right now. I can understand how that can happen. 

212 :  It is important that we work constructively to solve our problems and not resort to insults. 

213 :  I'm very sorry if this will cause you to leave Godot. 

214 :  I understand that some black people may not consider these terms offensive, but I would rather someone not want to work with me because they think I am too politically correct than because they think I am too insensitive and blind. 

215 :  Of course, if you @trivikr personally feel strongly about this then I support you :] 

216 :  If there's another way for this to work, I'm open to alternate ideas, but I think conditionally playbook imports would be generically useful. 

217 :  Please use the‘  button to let the maintainers know you need this feature. Getting a ton of emails from these +1s. 

218 :  I think you have a legitimate concern and I'm sorry if you feel like I'm ignoring you. 

219 :  I think you have a legitimate concern and I'm sorry if you feel like I'm ignoring you. 

220 :  do not you think that simply stating that I 'messed up writers" ' without explaining why is rude?" 

221 :  Look again, the name isn't Maui, the name is Multi-platform App UI which abbreviates to M.A.U.I. 

222 :  I hope this is not Microsoft's general attitude towards open source projects these days... 

223 :  bro I am an Open Source author and maintainer so don't try lecturing me about being against off-putting towards the open-source community"" 

224 :  That's not because others really love .NET, but because they try to stay constructive here. 

225 :  MauiKit whether you want to hear it or not has no fundamentals of what I as an Open Source Author and Maintainer would consider signs of a healthy project. 

226 :  We are talking about open source projects, there should be a common philosophy, not a competition for those who have the biggest issue counter. 

227 :  Sorry if I sounded harsh, that wasn't my intent. 

228 :  To be honest, this entire thread so far makes me far less inclined to introduce a dependency on the enterprise project. 

229 :  will have to move to a real open source tool like JMeter instead of gatling.  Sad. 

230 :  We are really sorry to hear this. 

231 :  Don't be so agitated 

232 :  For best outcome please consider writing your messages mindfully and calmly explaining both your problem and what is the suggested resolution or expectation for it. 

233 :  My sincere apologies.  I was in the wrong, and I've done you harm.  I'm sorry. 

234 :  Alex, sorry, I had gathered that you're recognized as the principle Windows maintainer. I didn't mean to invent a title. 

235 :  Well, I'm sorry for having been slightly edgy due to the total irrelevance of that statement with which he accompanies the news that he unblocked me. 

236 :  Let's be clear - you're telling *me* that I don't credit trade-offs or drawbacks, on a project I maintain, for a protocol that was designed a year ago, and for which noone has reported any automated breakage of any system, while still being able to migrate at the time of their choice. 

237 :  It's also been frustrating to be treated as a troll when I was called entitled but responded with a compliment. 

238 :  It was frustrating to see my point be misinterpreted as something else. 

239 :  I'm sorry if you felt your concern wasn't taken into consideration, I think it's simply because you believe, as you said, making future decisions based on trust is a mistake", while other people may not (I don't)." 

240 :  Think about that. 

241 :  I read some thoughtful and reasonable responses in this thread, and I understand how everyone has their point of view. 

242 :  Stop whining about that and remove the BLM from the site. 

243 :  grow some thicker skin and calm down. 

244 :  As a side note, the kind of errors hit by the users on the thread of this issue (lack of basic knowledge of Python for instance) tells me that we cannot solve their problem. 

245 :  He, being one of the top contributors to scikit-learn has to make tough decisions as to what will go into our codebase and what will not, as a more verbose documentation or tutorial might not be preferable for a lot of people. 

246 :  we understand your eagerness to solve your problem, and your frustration when it is not solved. 

247 :  I am very new in scikit-learn. 

248 :  I will be highly appreciated any useful advice. 

249 :  Sorry if this issue seems a bit salty, but it's really annoying 

250 :  I just lost hours worth of state because of this behavior. 

251 :  Just having automatic updates install upon next launch would be a perfectly fine behavior 

252 :  Unfortunately I am going to have to abandon it until this issue is fixed because I'm losing a lot of time and work every other week when an update is pushed and my long-running processes are lost. 

253 :  Don't act on theories! 

254 :  This is the second or third time I've been screwed over by Microsoft's shitty installation practices. 

255 :  The grass isn't greener on the other side... 

256 :  To be fair, @jeremylt, the 300hrs estimate was quite demotivating for me when I started. 

257 :  I don't believe anything I've said could fairly be labeled mansplaining, but I am sorry that I was curt 

258 :  This mistake is still haunting us years later, unfortunately. 

259 :  It's sad that I have to use such a long winded approach to try and defend its future and get certain parts of Microsoft to cooperate with other parts. 

260 :  Replace the template text and remove irrelevant text as the instruction says. 

261 :  I think it is more important that the main developer of Vim can concentrate on enhancing and improving Vim instead of having to change a workflow, that has been proven to be working well for the past 30 years. 

262 :  My words were met by defensiveness, ego, stubbornness, ignorance, and delusion. 

263 :  Starting a reply with the conversation is already over is not okay. 

264 :  Check out the web service to see how they want you to do it. If it's your own server, set it up properly. 

265 :  Make up your mind, updater… 

266 :  Have patience 

267 :  doesn't hurt to be polite. 

268 :  fork it, fix it, make a pull request and contribute. 

269 :  It seems here that Microsoft is taking an active approach to kill VB actively (as opposed to passive approach - just let it die by abandoning it). :-( 

270 :  I probably shouldn't make any more PR as they will fail. 

271 :  I feel my time creating that PR was wasted, so not rewarding, hence I'll think twice before making another PR. 

272 :  I feel my time creating that PR was wasted, so not rewarding, hence I'll think twice before making another PR. 

273 :  I'm sorry I don't have much time for other things beside work and family. 

274 :  I didn't realize a 4 line PR would pull me into a discussion on how to improve it by implementing a new code base and consequently figure why shippable would fail. 

275 :  I didn't realize a 4 line PR would pull me into a discussion on how to improve it by implementing a new code base and consequently figure why shippable would fail. 

276 :  Feel free do whatever you see fit, I'm off to other things, good luck & sorry for the noise. 

277 :  Feel free do whatever you see fit, I'm off to other things, good luck & sorry for the noise. 

278 :  I think it really has to do with time of day, traffic, alignment of the planets, etc. 

279 :  Sooooooooooooooo slowly :( 

280 :  My apologies for the frustration this issue has caused. 

281 :  It would be helpful if you could benchmark this with curl for reference. 

282 :  i wish Salt guys put the comments inside this source, listing all the bugs related to this module. 

283 :  i made quite many changes in that mounts.py - and now i am thinking about undoing almost all of them... Lack of any documentation... 

284 :  See... i know very little about Linux and nothing about Python, so i was googling everything i could think of :-) 

285 :  it is sad how fast you were to say Salt is all wrong and how protective you fet about OMV. 

286 :  Our customers have complained after opening the application for the first time :( 

287 :  Disappointing that this is not being considered high priority. 

288 :  Honestly, this issue made me re-consider of cross-platform frameworks being owned by the same company (Google here) will be supported at best, and ignoring quality metrics delivery on other platforms (iOS). 

289 :  The project needs lifesaving measures as it's community is dissatisfied enough to be discussing forks. 

290 :  Issues where opened and closed by the bot without any reponse, and nobody but you can do some critical things (merging pull requests, publishing fixes...). 

291 :  I hope people keep that vision in mind, when considering the near-term goals like providing prompt feedback directly on GitHub discussions, quick resolution for user-contributed PRs, maintenance releases etc. 

292 :  I do continue to feel pretty disappointed that the active project ownership that is so badly is still not coming in the near term. 

293 :  I agree your mind but really sad about results...  :-| 

294 :  PS : sorry for my poor english, frenchies are really bad with it :-) 

295 :  I love you Jack, for making SUI. I just hope you dont get crazy <3 

296 :  At the same time I must mention one thing: **you will not succeed on your own**. 

297 :  In that regard I find it highly confusing - and disrespectful imho - that you chose to ignore all suggestions to delegate power to trusted contributors who would like to help you to maintain SUI 2.x. 

298 :  PS: You will still be the captain ,) 

299 :  If you're just going to hack around with low level packets, then just use netty and don't bother us when things break. 

300 :  I understand that it won't be accepted, I'm not contesting that. 

301 :  be kind 

302 :  As a consumer of your product, I expect it to work as advertised 

303 :  So our apologies if some things take too long, or don't end up happening 

304 :  but it's wrong to blame the maintainers for this. 

305 :  Well I'm having trouble making a reproducer for this. 

306 :  it would be great if there was a built-in way to paginate a list Jekyll collection items on a page. 

307 :  it would be nice if there was a built in pagniation that worked for both post and collection items. 

308 :  would like to see Nested Collections. 

309 :  I would like to see [reading metadata in separate files] 

310 :  I would like to see the tags of collections included in site.tags. 

311 :  build in support for content blocks and components 

312 :  I'd very much love to have native support for Coffeescript in much the same manner as Sass. 

313 :  it would be great to have more interactions with github, like pulling profile information (contributions, avatar, ), releases data - and convert it for proper publication. 

314 :  I would like to see an automated tool like Webpack integrated into Jekyll to handle Sass and Javascript. 

315 :  I'd love to see Docker volume mounts work with Jekyll and Docker for Windows. 

316 :  I would love to see an offically supported page generator from data files. 

317 :  Make internal linking easier. 

318 :  Dont work with fb and google 

319 :  This is not the level of security awareness I expect Microsoft to have. 

320 :  work with your security teams to get the uploader qualified by at least the major vendors 

321 :  A company that does not understand the need of a full doc do not will offer a serious support in the long time 

322 :  Close this issue 

323 :  It would be nice to at least give an explanation before just closing an issue, this way nothing will get resolved, 

324 :  It would be nice to at least give an explanation before just closing an issue, this way nothing will get resolved, 

325 :  Wondering if Terminal users are mentally prepared to such amount of social activity in their lives.. switching from 0 social life to this directly might be... Overwhelming 

326 :  It's a fun-take and I wanted to upvote it for the fun part, but then I thought it may send the wrong message so I had to downvote it, just to not confuse newcomers. ,) 

327 :  The removal of the santa hat, and kowtowing to a fake user, is incredibly offensive to me. 

328 :  When I updated my VSCode, it was gone. 

329 :  If you don't do it I'll feel sad and disappointed. 

330 :  I'm deeply sorry for my insensitivity. 

331 :  Bring back the Santa's hat! 

332 :  I liked the santa hat, it brought a little joy to my day. Very sad that it has been removed. 

333 :  bring the hat back 

334 :  Bring back the hat. 

335 :  Put a satan hat back. 

336 :  add a Satan Hat! 

337 :  Assuming he was trolling: troll successful, gg 

338 :  I'm also not happy that the santa hat was removed, completely ignoring the public opinion here on GH. 

339 :  I def understand how frustrated you are, but every new platform has its shares of issues and stability. 

340 :  I understand you're frustrated, but having a positive attitude, even when you're stressed out or frustrated speaks volumes to others who are genuinely trying to help. 

341 :  Instead, when are you going to add REAL support for streaming?? 

342 :  I'm almost 40, and I bet I'm gonna die BEFORE you even get the idea to implement all of this!!! Pfffff............... 

343 :  that is painful 

344 :  Embrace the patterns of the npm ecosystem. 

345 :  Could you show me how to resolve this issue please? 

346 :  fork lerna and do it yourself. 

347 :  what a waste of time. 

348 :  We are talking things technically, don't make it personal. 

349 :  Calm down 

350 :  If you feel disrespect on nasty", I apologize." 

351 :  I think, you have many professional developers and why this F... RTL problem is not important for you? 

352 :  Why atom team don't like to fix this issue? 

353 :  Microsoft products are phenomenally bad and it's a wonder how you guys still stay in business. 

354 :  I suspect your whiteboarding hiring technique is ineffective and counterproductive. 

355 :  What's so special about installing .NET Core that it requires a different installation strategy? 

356 :  WTF? 

357 :  GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER MICROSOFT!!!! 

358 :  If I sound harsh, it's because I am sick and tired of Microsoft releasing half-baked products that don't work as expected. 

359 :  I would feel sorry for you guys like I would for the slow kid who klutzes around the basketball court, but this isn't your first time on the court with years of effort and tons of resources. 

360 :  It's why your own developers are using MacBook Pros for development. 

361 :  Telling us you are frustrated is fine, ranting is not. 

362 :  This is the kind of coding quality we get when corporations prioritizes employee diversity over code quality 

363 :  A thumbs down isn't enough on this one. There's zero tolerance for backwater attitude. Reporting. 

364 :  If people like me and you don't attempt it then we can wait another 3 years without anyone else picking the issue up. 

365 :  I am frankly fed up with this posture in open source projects. 

366 :  I've abandoned (a long time ago) the port effort and don't even use Dart anymore and will stop watching this rep. 

367 :  Why would I post this on the community site? I'm experiencing this problem on the travis-ci.com website?? 

368 :  you are showing how unappreciative and ignorant you can be. 

369 :  You can fault the devs for not getting this right with modules from the start, but aside from that, you should have more awareness of reality and what these changes have required before sharing those types of crass comments. 

370 :  In fact, you should probably not use any open source software, as the type of comment you left above are one of the major reasons why application developers give up on open source. 

371 :  Just because the software is open source doesn't mean we aren't paying for it. 

372 :  I honestly cannot believe how casual and dismissive you guys at MS are. 

373 :  I understand it must really difficult to do your job as a $1.75T company but can you try? 

374 :  Seeing you are happy to close issues and never respond to replies in closed issues, I am forced to open new issue. 

375 :  I would like to remind you that we are a small team of maintainers, and it has been less than or barely 24 hours since I responded to your issue yesterday. 

376 :  Telling users that they can use DSX but can't use debugger or enjoy auto-complete is a non starter for me. 

377 :  you are mixing everything I say and this conversation is going nowhere. In legal terms you are Badgering the witness"." 

378 :  I just don't have the time for this here. 

379 :  You failed to grasp that XML parsing (with some extra code to skip '{}' properly) is orders of magnitude simpler than fully parsing a programming language like Dart. 

380 :  you should invest you time and energy in writing up convincing arguments. 

381 :  You guys are suffering from NIH syndrome (Not-invented-here). Good artists copy, great artists steal", mediocre artists, well, behave like you." 

382 :  Really !!! nobody seems to bother to explain what exactly Flutter would gain... blah blah blah"." 

383 :  I don't want to argue against the feature but comments like if you don't do x then horribly y will happen" are just ridiculous." 

384 :  I think you underestimate how willing people are to try things, even when they're not fully polished. 

385 :  Obviously you didn't take my hint on length to heart but don't come to conclusions about my character because you don't know me at all. 

386 :  It is obvious to me that you are not very experienced with JSX, you really don't understand how it works. 

387 :  You are not the meter used to measure success and you don't know what I am up to. 

388 :  You equate me not having much experience with JSX and me not knowing how it works at all? 

389 :  my point still stands - that kind of comment is _still_ not appropriate here. 

390 :  Women can also be a construction worker  

391 :  This is the worst piece of advice anyone can give. 

392 :  Are you a I am the greatest dev alive" guy?" 

393 :  because if you even pause for a second to contemplate yes to any of those things you have a very rude awakening coming. 

394 :  It would also have been nice if you gave some actual reasoning behind your comment, not just flaming. 

395 :  I think I would rather become a rice farmer than ever touch WCF again. 

396 :  This is another good reason to not support WCF. Years of people implementing designs using WCF based on false assumptions or mythical functionality. 

397 :  If you don't like it, don't use it!!! 

398 :  Why try and stop others from using it? and most importantly why do so with absolutely no information just flaming? sorry but show me, tell me why? 

399 :  So, if this way of doing things is so terrible tell me why, don't just talk smack. Facts, Proof, Scientific Method... 

400 :  **I ask kindly post something informative and factual or just stop trolling.** 

401 :  Berating them to move to REST when it's impossible for them is neither clever nor helpful. 

402 :  This was last discussed more than five years ago and should be discussed again. 

403 :  for support reasons, you don't really have to ask what platform they're on, just mention the three paths in one sentence, it's actually rather easy. 

404 :  You're being a bit facetious. 

405 :  The third silly thing is that you're acting like IPython doesn't have any changes that break some pieces of code or tutorials out there. 

406 :  All in all it makes your comment seem more like irrational stubbornness than actual concerns. 

407 :  There's no need to update all the code and documentation all over the internet", nobody has every done that and never will." 

408 :  Now if it's to criticize the code without proper understanding of the technical and social reason of why it is the way it is, and bring XDG zealotry into the mix, I'm even less likely to make an effort. 

409 :  Also, your explanation still makes zero sense It's just re-identify the id if change" isn't even a proper sentence." 

410 :  Listen to his comment and stop suggesting this crudely thought-up bandaid of a fix"." 

411 :  Just PLEASE STOP. 

412 :  Care to explain why did you deleted my comment? 

413 :  Because it was completely inappropriate. Telling other contributors to not comment because you have no clue what you're talking about" is toxic behavior." 

414 :  Telling other contributors to not comment because you have no clue what you're talking about" is toxic behavior." 

415 :  While your contributions are clearly valuable, you need to accept that you're part of a larger community and need to treat others with respect. 

416 :  As such I don't care about what the code of conduct says because anyway I don't plan to contribute more work to this OSS project. 

417 :  Well, I consider his behavior to show a lack of respect for other's people work and time. 

418 :  Well, I appreciate they're appreciated but at the same time I don't really care. 

419 :  Nobody appreciates random/out of context quoting, straightforward answer avoidance, jumping to conclusions and whatnot. 

420 :  Working for fun doesn't imply that you get to do whatever you want and that there are no consequences. 

421 :  You shield yourself in the code of conduct and go OMG, how could people dare telling me that I'm wrong? 

422 :  Or perhaps you try to do better next time and avoid the not so fun part of messing up? 

423 :  And if you really do not know what you are talking about then what? 

424 :  Instead of an answer I've got some gibberish that tries to pass as code review or whatever that is supposed to be. 

425 :  It's exactly this unwillingness to learn from mistakes that brought us here. 

426 :  Feel free to continue to go down this path, the only thing you'll achieve is to dig the hole deeper. 

427 :  Yet here you are, telling me exactly that. 

428 :  Telling him that he doesn't know what he's talking about is unacceptable. 

429 :  If you want other people to learn, you need to give them more information beyond you're wrong"." 

430 :  You're basically sending him the signal of you're not welcome here"." 

431 :  if we observe behavior like this in the future, we'll ultimately block you. 

432 :  We can't have other contributors stop engaging with us because of your behavior. While your contributions are valued, they don't warrant losing other contributors as collateral damage. 

433 :  But instead of apologizing or even just letting that feedback sink in, you're now trying to turn the tables by saying you got victimized by Tanner because he asked you a technical question and that it's unreasonable from our end to ask you to be respectful in your responses to him. 

434 :  But instead of apologizing or even just letting that feedback sink in, you're now trying to turn the tables by saying you got victimized by Tanner because he asked you a technical question and that it's unreasonable from our end to ask you to be respectful in your responses to him. 

435 :  Oh, you gotta be joking. 

436 :  If you do not follow - can you ask other collaborators for help? 

437 :  Great attitude, especially as a _fastlane_ collaborator. Why not say it in here publicly? 

438 :  So instead of having a discussion and providing a counter example or presenting **any** reasoning why something would not be implemented, you are just discouraging people from helping _fastlane_... 

439 :  This is highly inappropriate. 

440 :  Do you really wonder why I don't want to spend any more time helping you? 

441 :  Mentioning other contributors that have not participated in the discussion is inappropriate as well, by the way. 

442 :  I do not think that looking for help in other contributors was inappropriate in that case as you clearly didn't want to take care of this issue. 

443 :  If people started paying for packages then they would be a lot more careful about the crap they select. 

444 :  YOU choose to spend your time on this project. 

445 :  If you aren't willing to contribute your code or your ideas to open source and aren't willing to contribute to projects monetarily, you should consider tempering your views. 

446 :  You guys seriously don't see what this guy is doing? He's trying to push his ESLint config as a standard" and monetize it." 

447 :  Not when that feedback is 100% predicable because it's nothing but our inner two year old being triggered to whine when everything doesn't go 100% his or her way. 

448 :  To place a copyleft licence on the work and then complain that you can't monetize it because people are copying it for free is an... interesting complaint. 

449 :  What an awful and misleading name for a eslint config. 

450 :  No, not all humans have this reaction.  The reaction you are projecting on all humans infers that all humans are greedy, inconsiderate thieves. 

451 :  Not letting your inner two year old rule you does not mean he is not present.  His complaints are predictable, and those who are voicing complaints from him are not needed. 

452 :  Please take your pseudo-intellectual garbage elsewhere 

453 :  Calling people triggered whining two-year olds doesn't contribute to this discussion constructively. 

454 :  should be ashamed of himself. 

455 :  It would be appreciable and civilized if you stopped calling the other's point of view &mdash, or the point of view you think they hold &mdash, stupid"." 

456 :  It would be appreciable and civilized if you stopped calling the other's point of view &mdash, or the point of view you think they hold &mdash, stupid"." 

457 :  Even worse, you don't seem to try to understand the other side point of view, and rush to your own conclusions. 

458 :  You move from **assumptions**,  **contracts** to **communicating**. 

459 :  Comparisons to Hitler are neither necessary nor welcome here, and anyone unable to debate the merits of *versioning schemes* without relying on that as a rhetorical device should rethink whether their participation here is going to lead to a constructive conversation. 

460 :  Is Microsoft's official answer to reporting a serious performance regression in a subsystem used every day by developers and admins who are managing and maintaining their user base really yeah we are aware of it but whether we will fix it and when, who knows"?" 

461 :  if you're unhappy with how the console is performing, go ahead and switch back to legacy mode. 

462 :  Don't struggle with this, Mike.  Again, if your mythical twenty year old stuff" doesn't work with the new Windows 10 console, by all means, use the old console, link in ANSICON, and keep relying on monkeypatching GetProcAddress (euughhhh)." 

463 :  In other words you want someone else to do the work for you „ 

464 :  You got the report and the working samples. 

465 :  So in your opinion you're free to mess it up, isn't it? 

466 :  Grow up first! 

467 :  Please stop collecting MY data and remove telemetry from all your f**g Windows products. 

468 :  Be thankful. Microsoft uses the data to improve your calculating experience. :smile: 

469 :  Just hoping Microsoft will not put backdoor, telemetry, obfuscation and all its shit in all Github projects, like others did in SourceForge. 

470 :  Just because a product is open-sourced doesn't mean you can go around making demands in this manner. 

471 :  I don't respect people who want to collect my PRIVATE data with software. 

472 :  If you don't like my demand, delete it. 

473 :  If you want better software, delete all these malwares. 

474 :  Because everybody today is speaking on the Net about a Windows Calculator with telemetry inside. I didn't believe even that was possible and... yes. 

475 :  What isn't respectful is polluting the issue-catalog with useless rants, poorly hidden profanity and shouting. 

476 :  I am, however, done with this issue now. 

477 :  you guys are worried about what data the calculator is collecting? what about the rest of windows lol 

478 :  You are not Calculator King of the Internet. 

479 :  A lot of time is being wasted doing what I've already done. 

480 :  The only negative opinions I get are from trolls or people who need an excuse for why they suck at the game. 

481 :  I do NOT need to upgrade, you miss the point. 

482 :  Avoiding Win10 is intentional, because I don't want my PC to have buggy, ugly, spying rubbish. 

483 :  I however suspect your comments are a little disingenuous 

484 :  you are entitled to believe what you like, but Windows 7 is coming to an end, and if you do not wish to remain a Windows user, there is macOS and various forms of Linux, for you to choose from. 

485 :  This isn't some Reddit thread for you to vent. 

486 :  Shortly, it's THE WORST system MS made (after Millenium). 

487 :  That's why I feel disappointed(angry) that you support Win10 and WITHOUT ANY REASON drop support for Win7. 

488 :  And funny, but NOT A SINGLE ANSWER were given by... hm... professionals"." 

489 :  You really need to take a step back and consider how you present yourself publicly. 

490 :  I have no desire to provide a professional response based on your attitude. 

491 :  This is absolutely unacceptable behavior 

492 :  Whoever came up with this idea clearly doesn't understand why ESLint was created in the first place. 

493 :  There are plenty of domains where you would like to give a function a name beginning with use"." 

494 :  You're not paying for it and the maintainers of this tool don't owe you anything. 

495 :  When you do post a complaint, you'll maximize your chances of getting what you want by avoiding incendiary language like absolutely unacceptable", "screaming", "atrocious", "carelessly", and "doesn't understand"." 

496 :  what's fuck google do? flutter is yours,golang is yours, why can't they live together? 

497 :  @akien-mga and other contributors.. get your shit together 

498 :  Whether it was a mistake or not is not decided by you, but the community as a whole. 

499 :  You are not the center of the universe. 

500 :  I have no idea what you are so angry about, just chill man. 

501 :  the only way someone can convince someone else to work on something on this project is good arguments from one side and the will to do it from the other side. 

502 :  you come off as quite hostile. 

503 :  I feel like I've seen you troll (that's what your comments amount to really) other GitHub projects also but I won't bother to check. Life is too short‹» 

504 :  you also completely dodged my point about the smiley emoji implementations. so i recommend a good feature for the engine **(inventory and other 2d stuff, that ALL GAME DEVELOPERS WILL BENEFIT FROM)**, but **you spit in my face**, claim that it's not low level enough", but then go around merging PRs for "emoji smiley" support for fonts? that's somehow still low level though? wtf??" 

505 :  so much for open source"." 

506 :  wtf?? 

507 :  can't have discussions without bypassing  / cheating github it seems! 

508 :  it's really hard for me to sit back and ignore what these companies are doing with my code. 

509 :  I have trouble expressing how angry this makes me feel. 

510 :  Do parents" who drag their children across the desert with the express intent of illegally entering the United States have no share of blame for what happens to these children?" 

511 :  It says nothing about people giving money to e.g. Microsoft or using Microsoft products. 

512 :  Maybe they would have dropped in to tell us it won't be accepted and not to waste any effort on it? 

513 :  go listen to them and stop relying on those soulless motherfuckers at Facebook to give a damn about you. 

514 :  to be honest, this response is borderline unacceptable and I don't even know what to reply. Wow. 

515 :  What the actual hell is your goal here? 

516 :  You're screwing Lerna, not the companies listed 

517 :  Meanwhile you're getting massive community backlash that's only going to continue if you decide to be a child and inappropriately release this as a minor version bump or with the MIT license. 

518 :  The best thing feasible for Lerna at this point is you leaving the project 

519 :  The best thing feasible for Lerna at this point is you leaving the project 

520 :  the second best thing is everyone moving to a fork of the project without a politician having any control. 

521 :  The irony is I 100% agree with your politics, but this is not the place to express them. 

522 :  it sucks if I have to spend my evening checking a bunch of old repos because you'll _maybe_ release this as a patch. 

523 :  So I fucked off and told them to eat shit. 

524 :  Once upon a time I thought I had to go work for those big corporations that I hate in order to do the kind of open source work I want to do. That turned out to be incredibly false. So I fucked off and told them to eat shit. 

525 :  If you want to restrict who can use lerna, then lerna can no longer be called free, it will be proprietary. 

526 :  Calls for civility are perfectly apt after an issue like this. Suggesting that asking people to be nice" is an attempt at ending discussion is one of the strangest stretches I've ever heard. As someone that called maintainers cowards for reverting the changes and removing Jamie, I can get a strong sense of why you'd argue that point, however." 

527 :  do you really want transparency, or are you looking for a fight? 

528 :  If you're looking for rancorous sniping and harmful drama" you might try using a mirror." 

529 :  Explain how me, the person who made the decision, not employed by Microsoft, was secretly paid by Microsoft to ruin open source. Should be an amusing story. 

530 :  So for all this grandstanding you're doing -- why not delete your GitHub account...seriously -- MS will own GitHub soon. Also -- change your OS from Windows -- if you use that... 

531 :  Oh Jesus nevermind -- I'm an idiot I guess :joy: -- apologies :) 

532 :  Sure, I'm sure you could argue Adolf was a pretty cool guy if you ignore all the other stuff he did and just focus on his gun control policy. ”¥ 

533 :  This is really frustrating 

534 :  This is stupid! 

535 :  There is a bug here and posting that this is fixed is misleading. 

536 :  Honest question: does anybody read what I've been posting about this issue? 

537 :  Did you actually read the thread? 

538 :  The problem is nbot the ability to permanently remove files, please the first message of the issue... It's explicit. 

539 :  You assumed the most common error was because `gvfs-trash` was not installed. 

540 :  This thread is the proof it's no more the case. Please, update. 

541 :  I would direct people to actually read the bug report before commenting. 

542 :  Well great let me just ship your computer around so everyone can use it. 

543 :  Or even better we will buy everyone a plane ticket and then can come stand in line to use your computer where the software does work. 

544 :  I dont understand why people working for google have such a problem admting they make mistakes...  everybody does, what makes difference is fix them or not. 

545 :  i cant even imagine a meeting to present the product: Here we have a new tool that will allow developers to set constants remotelly, helping with A/B tests and allowing the developer to change apps behavior without re-deploy." 

546 :  You just told me that if someone has an app in both architectures and want to use the default values THIS PERSON MUST DEFINE EVERY FIELD 3 TIMES... does it sound smart? 

547 :  I hate to be rude and also hate to teach people how to do their jobs. but this architecture design of firebase RC is a clear mistake, anyone with a basic software engineer understand should be able to see that. 

548 :  I'm sorry to tell you but this isnt frustrating" this is a super stupid architecture design..." 

549 :  This is very much a case of Old Microsoft" rearing it's head, rather then new forward looking Microsoft." 

550 :  We can disagree here and have debates, but please halt yourself before assuming the motivations of others and attacking individuals personally or their work. 

551 :  If you're unhappy with them, you're absolutely free to change them. 

552 :  did you perhaps recognise the truth of what I wrote and felt defensive? 

553 :  I am so tempted to chime in with something more confrontational but I don't think it'll add to the debate 

554 :  if you expect it to meet all your needs straight away you probably need to realign your expectations. 

555 :  you're getting a little extreme. 

556 :  Good recommendation, but the you'll sound like Yoda" is too informal for a disclaimer." 

557 :  **I REALLY DISAGREE WITH THIS PR** 

558 :  This is actually nonsensical statement. 

559 :  you are being overly defensive when the whole argument was about Godot, not BGFX. 

560 :  You seem to be assuming that just because of adding BGFX support, everything will be fine and no one will ever have to learn how the underlying APIs work. 

561 :  thanks a lot for your enthusiasm, but I am the one doing the rendering work in Godot, not you. 

562 :  As always with Godot, you are free to make your own renderer with BGFX, show me that it's flawless, has better better performance, works better than mine (of course while supporting the full Godot feature set) and uses less resources and code to prove me wrong.. as well as commiting full time over the next years to maintain it. 

563 :  If you want a revolution, begin with it yourself. 

564 :  If you want to prove your ideas, invest in them because words are free. 

565 :  What a classic example of elitism and douchebaggery. 

566 :  I will stay miles away from Godot and any projects you maintain, thanks. 

567 :  I will stay miles away from Godot and any projects you maintain, thanks. 

568 :  Nobody's saying it shouldn't use the network. 

569 :  It just shouldn't use the network *before the user has given it permission*, because otherwise it is a **data leak**. 

570 :  That's *why the consent dialog exists*. 

571 :  That seems to be a recurring issue 

572 :  You need to reopen this one too, because, inconvenient or not, autoupdate checks are also an inadvertent form of telemetry *whether the project uses them for the purpose or not*. 

573 :  It doesn't matter if the telemetry is coming from the telemetry package" or not." 

574 :  As already stated, if that form of telemetry" is an issue for you feel free to block the network access or create a version of Atom that doesn't check for updates." 

575 :  What about the thousands of other users who haven't spent time and money on things like Little Snitch, who nevertheless don't want to be tracked and explicitly opt out of telemetry that still get telemetry sent (and logged by their government forever) against their wishes? 

576 :  If you're going to insist on the autoupdate thing, couldn't you just do it once per month, at a random number of cumulative hours delay (say, 1-12) after startup, so that it doesn't function as an ad hoc user has launched the app" telemetry event to everyone watching and logging the network?" 

577 :  If you're going to insist on the autoupdate thing, couldn't you just do it once per month, at a random number of cumulative hours delay (say, 1-12) after startup, so that it doesn't function as an ad hoc user has launched the app" telemetry event to everyone watching and logging the network?" 

578 :  As I have stated multiple times you can definitely work with Atom while offline (or with network requests blocked). 

579 :  I do think that while delivered in a dictatorial manner, comment is worth discussing more. 

580 :  Aww.. Here, have a beer on me: :beer: 

581 :  There is also room now to put Google Ads in the exception messages. 

582 :  If you, or somebody else, think Node.js *should* address one of the particular concerns, and are willing to help in making that happen, Im sure we can arrange that. :slightly_smiling_face: 

583 :  Largely a duplicate of #19826 from earlier this year.  The answer is still 'no'. 

584 :  If you don't have anything relevant to say, stay quiet 

585 :  Your heavy-handed and dismissive approach to moderation diminishes the project and the whole community. 

586 :  Just because you are afraid taking responsibility doesn't mean someone else won't step up to it. 

587 :  Just because you are afraid taking responsibility doesn't mean someone else won't step up to it. 

588 :  You suck at it. 

589 :  it's bullshit solution. 

590 :  It's hard to predict what you want, because it's not clear what you want. 

591 :  Jesus, I wish you guys STFU and get back to work instead. 

592 :  Too bad maintainers do not mute the thread. 

593 :  I'll have to unsubscribe from the ticket because it's unbearable to get emails with flame wars. 

594 :  I've been spending WAY too much time on adding bootstrap 4 with npm to a webpack project. 

595 :  I just installed, included, imported and my app just runs fine, no errors, but yet no col-md or container styling working.. meh, i'll just return to CDN's... 

596 :  But also, I don't want to be mean but I would prefer not to have this kind of discussions. 

597 :  This is once again NOT a bug and it is up to you to now change the way you deal with your animations. 

598 :  If you don't want to call it a bug, it's very bad design at the very least. 

599 :  I am **once again**, going to explain how the frame property works within the engine: you select a frame, which is numbered from left to right, then from top to bottom. 

600 :  And once again, there is nothing to fix here, unless you have a real solution" to the problem." 

601 :  we won't solve your problem by introducing workarounds in the code, sorry. 

602 :  What the hell? 

603 :  Your issue doesn't contain a single bit of useful information anybody could act on. 

604 :  At best the problem is that your expectations are wrong and you blame Angular instead of adjusting yourself, and the worse case is that you are just spreading spam. 

605 :  Angular works great for most. If it doesn't for you it's highly likely the problem is on your end. 

606 :  You need to stop acting like 3-year old. 

607 :  You need to stop acting like 3-year old. 

608 :  Grow up, get your sh*t together and stop spamming. 

609 :  don't cry, contributor, you are not blame that you are into that sh*t 

610 :  the reality is just opposite, it is the very suitable framework especially for real big projects. Just to guess, your problem is probably that you see it / try to use it by the same way as from jQuery point of view which is totally wrong way. 

611 :  whats the problem to answer this question? 

612 :  I don't even understand what the problem is and you don't seem to be interested to explain it. 

613 :  I don't even understand what the problem is and you don't seem to be interested to explain it. 

614 :  LOL - you simply closed my issue - where is your interest? 

615 :  LOL - you simply closed my issue - where is your interest? 

616 :  Because you do not know the answer about the raw response in gitter? 

617 :  I don't even care if that is directly in your code or was pulled in via a dependency bump. 

618 :  I'd say that's much worse than a temporarily broken build. 

619 :  I'm sorry my fuckups have caused you pain. 

620 :  And even if you do feel there is responsibility, you should not be so rude. 

621 :  Unintended breaking changes happen, but blaming it on the consumers is not an appropriate response. 

622 :  your reaction to the mistake being brought to your intention is somewhere between condescending and hostile. 

623 :  Instead you said that it's good that your mistake broke my build. 

624 :  You could have said sorry, this was not intended, let me roll back and re-release as 4.0.0" and it would be fine." 

625 :  You could have said sorry, I didn't consider that the yargs API practically becomes part of the lerna API, I will make sure that future SemVer major updates of yargs only happen in SemVer major updates of lerna"" 

626 :  However, I do see much evidence that you are trying to crash through head first through Angular and I see it as you feel it should just work the way you want it to... 

627 :  You either consume it all OR you will be wingin' it" and fighting the current of how things actually work versus how you want them to work." 

628 :  **angular team doesn't care about users feedback at all** 

629 :  Soooooooooooo youre setting Angular on fire and saying bold shit in bold like the Angular team dont care about you cause you found relative pathing has an issue is an odd area 

630 :  I felt Angular 2 to Angular 4 stuck it to me in the ace hole butttttttttttttt alas past my bitching, it all was for the better 

631 :  The topic here has just been a bunch of bitching where I have found success in the CLI and lazy loading. 

632 :  Im NOT going to create some plunked to split hairs with you 

633 :  Unprofessional for Flutter team to have this issue for more than 1 year. 

634 :  It is just shows up the whole Google company style - quantity over quality. 

635 :  may I remind you of the code of conduct of this repository which strongly encourages a kind behaviour? 

636 :  you are really think that is the Apple's problem? 

637 :  No one is even assigned to this issue yet? 

638 :  Guys from Flutter team, you spend tone of time to learn algorithms, data structure, low level programming for get work in Google and for now is it actually that type of solution you wanna provide being hired by the one of the best company in the world? Crutch? 

639 :  Guys from Flutter team, you spend tone of time to learn algorithms, data structure, low level programming for get work in Google and for now is it actually that type of solution you wanna provide being hired by the one of the best company in the world? Crutch? 

640 :  When you solve this issue(instead of provide workaround) Flutter will be best SaaS decision in the world, even for iOS users! 

641 :  I wonder why neither my proposal of shipping MSL nor the proposal of an optimisation run got a response from anyone from the team. 

642 :  Guys, I think we should start reaching out to the press about this issue. 

643 :  Ultimately the priorities of the flutter dev team are set by business stakeholders, I think. 

644 :  Show us ONE request from ANYONE who asked for their TABs to be changed to spaces within their code when using the option KEEP TABS. 

645 :  Come on people, this is not rocket science, it's a text editor for $(Deity)'s sake! 

646 :  Obviously it's more convient to blindly deny it here rather than simply fix it. 

647 :  How about not commenting before understanding what you read? 

648 :  You butted into the middle of a discussion by putting words in my mouth because you haven't bothered to understand what I wrote. 

649 :  So now you are implying that I don't even know what I want? 

650 :  What's next, telling me to get used to doing things your way because reasons? 

651 :  If this is a feature, and not a bug, then someone please explain why, when **Always keep TABs** is selected, these TABs are being replaced by Spaces? 

652 :  It's VERY unpredictable and frustrating. 

653 :  It may be worse for you, but better for others.  Hence the dilemma :) 

654 :  You'd see things very differently if on some lines of your code, your spaces were constantly being replaced by tabs. 

655 :  99% of what you wrote translates into excuses to not even attempt to change anything because something could break while at the same time you are totally disregarding that it has already been broken for us, hence the bug reports. 

656 :  99% of what you wrote translates into excuses to not even attempt to change anything because something could break while at the same time you are totally disregarding that it has already been broken for us, hence the bug reports. 

657 :  it is clear that you enjoy imposing your way on others given your ban on tabs" which you mentioned above." 

658 :  So far you have not addressed any of my points, instead you keep spouting some weird mix of anti-tab religious zealotry and corporate PR talk. 

659 :  At the risk of getting banned from commenting on this and every other Microsoft repo I am going to call you out on your bullshit -- you, Sir, are full of it and presenting rational arguments to you is a colossal waste of time. 

660 :  At the risk of getting banned from commenting on this and every other Microsoft repo I am going to call you out on your bullshit -- you, Sir, are full of it and presenting rational arguments to you is a colossal waste of time. 

661 :  i am out of here, and I will be advocating in my company to drop Visual Studio licensing. 

662 :  Maybe you will learn to honor user's preferences when they hit you in the wallet. 

663 :  It's open for God knows for how long just like this one. 

664 :  This misbehavior on tabs was reported shortly after the release of the VS2015 version, multiple times, by different people. 

665 :  You developed an new auto format engine and it fails to give the same good experience as the one that was used before and instead of fixing it, you prefer to spend hours of discussion with arguments that have nothing to do with the given issue. 

666 :  How much patience do you expect, by people that have to deal with this bug on every day? 

667 :  That is NOT expected behaviour. 

668 :  And today here we are approx. 6 years since the release of Visual Studio 2015 where the issue was introduced and you are telling me that you need more time to make sure someone is not negatively impacted while people using tabs are negatively impacted for 6 years and counting. 

669 :  I hope by now you are noticing a pattern, because the same kind of discussion is going on here as well. 

670 :  If you do bother to read those discussions as I asked you to, you will hopefully see how much of my personal time and effort I have spent on submitting the issue, and explaining things that Microsoft's own software engineers should have known better than me. 

671 :  In case what I am hinting at isn't clear, the difference is that I am a customer who is paying for the OS and dev tools licenses who is spending own free time to help improve things, and your colleagues are doing this on the salary and with this kind of response I am getting I have absolutely no incentive to contribute further. 

672 :  I have the urge to drop Microsoft products and suggest to the company I work for that we do the same wherever we can 

673 :  So no other editor exhibits this behaviour, no editor before 2015 exhibited this behaviour, people are here reporting it as a bug, but you're are suggesting that it fixed some problem endemic since the dawn of computing. 

674 :  That's bemusing to me, but if you're happy with it, then lucky you. 

675 :  Why It's not working? >:E There is no objective reasons for that. 

676 :  Do not distract me for this nonsense 

677 :  It would be much easier to understand if you simplified the example somewhat (remove the extra calls inside your auth service) and explained what you're actually looking for. 

678 :  This issue doesn't provide the steps to reproduce, or the exact expectation you're looking for with the example provided. 

679 :  i am from india my name is ramjeet widevin is shit .!! 

680 :  I'll be brief: It's because of guys like you that this device is being revoked. 

681 :  You - the person creating this issue is shit btw 

682 :  not widevine or the player, not even hiding the fact that you're using decryption keys illegally. 

683 :  It's because of people like you that real device owners and users can't use their devices as expected anymore. 

684 :  if you violate our code of conduct again, you will be permanently banned. 

685 :  Why is this issue still assigned to the `2.5 milestone` when `ansible 2.5` is already release a long time ago ? 

686 :  Running into this issue again and it sucks. 

687 :  Please guys, this issue has been open for almost 2 years now and for people who really use ansible-vault, this is a major pain the butt. 

688 :  We need a new free option, this is a core component and cannot be outsourced to 3rd party companies.  **THIS IS TOO CRITICAL** 

689 :  If you can't afford $1500 a year for IdentityServer4 to manage something as critical as identity for your business applications, drop them a line and let them know - pricing software products is a complicated business. 

690 :  OSS software isn't about other people doing things for you for free 

691 :  Funny how while it's been free, depending on 3rd parties has never been a problem... 

692 :  we'll make an announcement when ready"" 

693 :  Microsoft doesn't have to own everything dotnet. 

694 :  The sky isn't falling. 

695 :  If the answer is none" then _you're the problem_." 

696 :  I don't expect some - again VERY BASIC - functionality in my tech stack to change the licence 180°. 

697 :  It was their mistake to promote IS in the first place without making sure that it keeps the same license **forever** 

698 :  What an idi0t, not ok, just because he dont agree with someone else view. 

699 :   is out of line with personal comments like that. 

700 :  Clearly there's complexity in auth in general and within IS, and let's not pretend otherwise. 

701 :  Some of you were hopping over the line, some of you hopped over it, sprinted in the wrong direction and then threw things from 2.7 miles past the line. 

702 :  In any case, this is not the venue to discuss Duende's pricing, what open source means, and whether Microsoft should produce everything and kill off the .NET open source ecosystem in the process. 

703 :  We're done here and I'm locking the issue. 

704 :  Go linters complain when exported variables or constants are not documented (despite them being obvious in many cases), yet when core developers make major changes to go, they keep the old documentation, and don't even bother making it up-to-date. 

705 :  It was a neutral-tone, you might have never actually attached or imagined negative connotations to it if it weren't for me saying excuse me for my tone", which I have only said because I know how often people imagine hostility where there is none. :relaxed:" 

706 :  I cannot control how other people feel about me, and what emotions they attach to my statements. 

707 :  Despite what you say your words and actions do have a large impact on how people feel about what you write and how people interact with you. 

708 :  currently ` Dart` is more like: You want to do web? Sure, use AngularDart." (Hint: AngularDart != "the web")" 

709 :  LOL, no way. 

710 :  My commit is PUBLIC DOMAIN, do with it as you please. 

711 :  Perhaps also ask the lawyers what happens if someone later goes and fixes that typo. Thats basically stealing my public domain idea, regardless of your CLA, and then claiming it isnt because this wasnt known to you. 

712 :  Whacky position to be in :) 

713 :  Someone should start a GoFundMe campaign to pay for a lawyer who will challenge Google all the way to the Supreme Court, LOL 

714 :  I have OCD and I really want that typo fixed, now I know its there, it annoys me LOL. 

715 :  Can we please go back to focus on the issue at hand now, instead of having a meta discussion about how long people have had to test this. It is what it is right now, so let's look forward. 

716 :  I am amazed by how you, as the teacher, managed to avoiding pronouncing _any_ of the directives as en-gee" during the whole workshop." 

717 :  Did the girl really not notice the pattern of `ng-app`-`ng-init`-`ng-model`-`ng-if` leading to `ng-repeat`? 

718 :  Being curious about an official origin doesn't mean you're confused. 

719 :  a question on StackOverflow asking for the etymology of the `ng-` prefix is by no means evidence that it is a confusing name"." 

720 :  The project is already as inclusive as it gets: _everyone_ is welcome to use it and participate in its evolution by contributing, pointing out bugs, asking questions and helping others. Changing `ng-` to `ang-` would not affect this fact, positively or negatively. 

721 :  Furthermore, I am amazed by how you, as the teacher, managed to avoiding pronouncing _any_ of the directives as en-gee" during the whole workshop." 

722 :  I find it fascinating that someone at an Angular workshop was confused. 

723 :  Also, it would certainly not be easier to remember" because that would mean changing every existing material online." 

724 :  By this logic ang- is a terrible choice as it could stand for anything from negative words like ang-ry to religious words like ang-el. 

725 :  Trying to find two or three letters that are universally innocent in every language in a way that you cannot somehow turn them into something negative is probably an impossible task. 

726 :  Responding to that feeling by saying, basically, you are wrong" is practically providing proof that the angular community is not that welcoming." 

727 :  That sentence reads as a euphemism for that girl is stupid". Again: Not. Welcoming." 

728 :  Great, I'm glad you don't interpret `ng-repeat` negatively. 

729 :  It's so unbelievably annoying! 

730 :  This keeps coming up and it is SO ANNOYING. 

731 :  The people who's job it is to improve Visual Studio's user experience would be better equipped to fix this. 

732 :  Teams prioritizing things different from you is not negligence. 

733 :  The (ir)responsible team at Microsoft is neglecting a lot of users by not fixing this bug. 

734 :  It is a minor issue" in that it'd be easy for them to fix, although the choose not to.  It's not a "minor issue" in that it is indeed super annoying." 

735 :  And, as mentioned above, if that order doesn't fit your desires, you actually have something you can do about it. 

736 :  You seem to be seeking some sort of recognition and I must concede it to you. 

737 :  You have a knack for justifying inaction. 

738 :  I don't have time.  Nor really for this pointless discussion, although I hope you got something out of it at least. 

739 :  If you view my willingness to work with you to fix hte issues you care about as inaction" then that's on you." 

740 :  Thus it would be very unreasonable to expect app developers to do _even more_ work in the form of _unpaid_ casual side-jobs for various other projects such as Visual Studio etc, while simultaneously trying to perform their normal job 

741 :  It would be wildly unreasonable to expect app developers to sacrifice all of the following.  * Sacrifice mental health (re burn-out) as a consequence of excessive workload / unpaid side-jobs. * Sacrifice the proper raising of own children (applicable to everyone that has children), because of excessive time and energy spent doing unpaid side-jobs, resulting in insufficient time/energy remaining to properly raise and take care of children. * Sacrifice the relationship with partner/girlfriend/boyfriend/wife/husband. * Sacrifice a healthy amount of social life with friends and relatives (this loss can also lead to degradation of mental health). * Sacrifice relaxation/leisure time (insufficient leisure time also damages mental health). * Sacrifice fair working conditions and remuneration for staff members of businesses. * Sacrifice ethical behavior. 

742 :  However, it would be wildly unreasonable to expect to sacrifice himself like you do. 

743 :  My personal opinion is that your behavior appears to be unethical, inappropriate, and unprofessional, and it does not belong in any GitHub repository linked with Microsoft. 

744 :  Does that not strike you as ridiculous? 

745 :  You seem strangely passionate about defending their inaction. 

746 :  This is a delightful vignette about why we have rebindable key actions, and why we don't want to be prescriptive with user experience where terminal input" is concerned." 

747 :  your comment makes zero sense here. 

748 :  What C++ and/or Swift do isn't part of our decision making process for C#. 

749 :  'annoying' was not part of the decision making process. 

750 :  The language direction is not decided by polls. 

751 :  It should not be about believing or feeling ... It is not technical terms, there is should be Mind Map - what this feature will provide and allow to achieve ... 

752 :  It is entirely about that.  The language design group chooses which features are added to the language based on their personal beliefs and feelings. 

753 :  You underestimate our real usage 

754 :  Because he's continually said that this proposal had been rejected, he's said why it was rejected, and thus all this complaining on a rejected issue is just noise. 

755 :  If you want to talk about it further, do so where you have been asked to go. 

756 :  If you don't want to do that, you obviously don't care as much about your proposal as you seem to. 

757 :  This isn't your language. If it was, you'd be free to make all the changes you want, whatever the consequences, but it isn't. 

758 :  This isn't your language. 

759 :  Whether you did that or not is entirely up to you, but please stop moaning here, as you have been politely asked to do multiple times... 

760 :  I've seen you get upset and belligerent before when a proposal didn't go the way you wanted - it's getting old. 

761 :  But then the argument and debate must go into the gutter like chat channel to make it easier to forget, that's all reasoning I could understand about why we need to go there, the team just don't want to listen or even have clear evidence that people appeared to go against your decision (I might be overthinking things but this was one technique a dictator would used to suppress opinion of people) 

762 :  But for assumption that this feature will have `minimal usage` is very unlikely and very vague argument 

763 :  But not only there are no further explanation, you just demand people voice's to be drained into gitter and discord instead of the issue topic itself. 

764 :  This is what I really would called unreasonable 

765 :  But now you just don't want discussion to be under the issue and we don't have reason why it changed 

766 :  NOISE!! 

767 :  The difference is that those people gracefully did as was suggested as opposed to continually whine. 

768 :  You are acting like a petulant child, so I ask once again, if you're not willing to follow Cyrus' suggestion to move this discussion, PLEASE STOP! 

769 :  You seem to have some entitled opinion that just because you would find something useful, everybody else must, and thus it must be included in the language, and you're not willing to accept no" as an answer." 

770 :  END. FINIS. DONE. 

771 :  The decision making process is not done in a measured or mechanical fashion. 

772 :  This entire meta discussion on how people want the language designed is not useful here. 

773 :  (insert ominous music here) 

774 :  You guys aren't big fans of the KISS principle, I see. 

775 :  Microsoft once again doesn't fail to disappoint. 

776 :  my next action will be to get rid of this software immediately. 

777 :  I _dont_ appreciate you expressing it by heaping it on top of everybody I work with. 

778 :  Hi! Im a real person, happy to have a dialogue about that. 

779 :  This isn't the first time Microsoft is forcing good ideas" down my throat - if it was, I'd be happy to ask you about them directly, but this is just another data-point in a long history of similarly user-hostile actions." 

780 :  The irony of this statement is significant. You are literally clueing the user in to the opposite. I performed a customisation, and it is undone. This doesn't appear to be customisable"" 

781 :  You're right that our userbase is a technical audience, which is why we expected them to be able to <!--rub two brain cells together, and-->take the four seconds it takes to read the synthesized JSON, see the `hidden": false` that we stick in there, and think "hmm, maybe that hides the profile ”"." 

782 :  How about ASKING THE USER? Did that ever cross your mind? 

783 :  Hey, I've detected that you've made a change in the config. I'm about to undo all your work and confuse the hell out of you, Would you like me to continue?"" 

784 :  I even had people write to me to fix this today, that you guys are not seeing this is a huge issue like it is, shows where your priorities are. 

785 :  I know that also see people having this issues daily and even he has it, it's funny you guys dont think that is a huge problem.. 

786 :  As I stated, there is not enough time to duplicate all CI builds and to fix all the bugs that would get uncovered from there. 

787 :  The tool should serve the purpose, not the other way around! 

788 :  If you decide to solve it what's the point of saying in the middle okay now it's too difficult"." 

789 :  you should already know that things that *appear* trivial can, in fact, turn out to be intractable, and being combative about that helps no one. 

790 :  Did you a) (only) respond to the issue, or did you b) choose to unnecessarily attack my experience? 

791 :  So feels like it is the other way around to me. ‚ 

792 :  your attitude here makes my day measurably worse. 

793 :  I've asked you to do this once already and am not going to ask a third time - if you continue to be combative to people just trying to help, we'll be asking you to discontinue your engagement on the issue tracker. 

794 :  Your comment is insulting and more than useless 

795 :  bitch needs a slap 

796 :  Keep in mind that violations of the code of conduct can result in being banned. 

797 :  I always try to remind participants that we are *all* striving to make TypeScript better - but if you want to participate, the only way to do so is with respect. 

798 :  We can't tolerate abrasive language or tone on this issue tracker, and it has clearly become a problem here, so I'm closing the thread. 

799 :  If you cannot do that, we cannot allow you to engage on the issue tracker. 

800 :  I'm fed up the whole framework is filled with this crap. 

801 :  Why you even do double way binding if works half the needed cases? 

802 :  Don't even make a framework at this point 

803 :  It has no fucking sense. 

804 :  If the customer didn't specifically asked for angular I would have thrown this piece of trash in the toilet long time ago 

805 :  Thumbs down my ass, it's reality  that smacks your face 

806 :  Spoiler: no template i have no time to waste 

807 :  Instead of thumbing down like twitter and facebook kids, show me I'm wrong ¥‡ 

808 :  thumbs down don't bother me, take some relief on your real life frustration and let them rain down ’¯ 

809 :  Thats the damn problem 

810 :  Hundreds of issues at day you say. A stable and mature and professional product after all these years shouldnt. 

811 :  Instead it leaves you clueless with these kind of things and stupid documentation which is a copy paste from semi working code samples from tour of heroes which in some case alre also wrong and with errors in it. 

812 :  Yeah don't cry in silence and show us your strong arguments against my point 

813 :  This long reply is to show that I'm not just an angry fool, lot of people is fed up with it and it actually is an half baked crippled tool 

814 :  But there is an even more FUNNY thing. I AM ACTUALLY ALREADY USING setValue even before writing this post!!! 

815 :  At some point you have to trust engine contributors to know what bugs are. 

816 :  Here, renamed, be happy. 

817 :  This is getting silly already. No way it makes any sense. 

818 :  How is this offtopic? Please stop bringing politics into development world. That's just mindblowingly silly. 

819 :  That is hilarious. 

820 :  What is the next requirement OpenJS will ask for? To remove the **test** directory to avoid similarity with **test**icles? 

821 :  I'm not understanding why tasks could be included dynamically, but a playbook wouldn't be. 

822 :  I need to conditionally import a playbook, which isn't possible.  The keyword I'm missing is include_playbook" which would allow a "when" to apply to it." 

823 :  Of course we do. 

824 :  Oh, so you monitor them, but completely ignore them. Much better. 

825 :  You are making toxic and unhelpful statements. 

826 :  If you want to continue to make mean and unhelpful assumptions and remarks, go ahead, but then we can just close down this whole thread as well. 

827 :  Sarcasm and profanity will not help you get your issues resolved. 

828 :  I find it extremely frustrating using terminal as a REPL. 

829 :  I think it's quite stubborn to say you know what your users want. 

830 :  TBH, you really can't force down the throat of what tastes bland. 

831 :  If you don't like the new window, that's fine. 

832 :  If you don't want to give feedback on the new idea, because you just want us to fix the original REPL, that's fine too. 

833 :  Actually, please don't fix it. I am not paying you. And you believe you have the best idea, and that my request is too much. 

834 :  No, I don't think spending some personal time investigating a problem you have with a software you got from me for free is rude"." 

835 :  I've pointed out your mistake and you are perfectly capable of spotting the difference between the original configuration that was working and you've commented out and the one you've changed and that don't. 

836 :  Too bad that you do not consider this rude 

837 :  you do not care. 

838 :  it just not helpful to make false statements like: 'works for me' and 'you messed up writers' because you did not bother to run the repro-case following very simple instructions. 

839 :  If I state that your sample works for me", it of course means that I did bother running it on my side and didn't get to reproduce the issue you're mentioning." 

840 :  Perhaps the Linux project should change its name as they've conflicted with a city in Hawaii which existed long before. 

841 :  I feel like there's much less confusion between a city in Hawaii and a multi platform app framework both called Maui than a multi platform app framework and a multi platform app framework both called Maui. 

842 :  So you think of a Hawaian city when reading Maui", but not when reading "MAUI"? Really?" 

843 :  You find the comparison between a city in Hawaii and MauiKit ridiculous just like I find your comparison between an the Maui abbreviation and MauiKit ridiculous 

844 :  So yeah, there's an obvious naming clash here 

845 :  How is having two product with the same name and same basic scope (multi platform framework) a non issue? 

846 :  this project you're fighting for so passionately, doesn't have as many stars as I have thumbs down for telling you that you'e being ridiculous 

847 :  That's because GitHub stars are not a currency in which you measure a project that is not even developed on GitHub. 

848 :  I don't think they took into account either confusion with the Linux project" *nor with the Hawaiian island*." 

849 :  By the way, is it seriously necessary to mention that when there's an obvious name conflict with some other free software project in the exactly same domain (UI toolkit)? 

850 :  get over this Linux vs. Windows" mantra you still seem to follow." 

851 :  yes, this was half sarcasm, half serious comment. I think you can figure out which half's which. 

852 :  And this is not even a confusing _similarity_. We are talking about a multi platform framework called MAUI, and a multi platform framework called MAUI. 

853 :  You could've at least googled the name you were giving to your product before doing so, or choose one that's used from a product with a different scope. 

854 :  so you like this cute little side project... but let's be honest here when it comes to being a serious project it's not one. 

855 :  Your attitude is as if Microsoft is being some big evil corporation. 

856 :  Ok let's look at kde... there are 10 open issues... are you seriously going to tell me that a serious cross platform framework has 10 open issues... that's not realistic in any shape way or form. So again your complaints are just being ridiculous. 

857 :  The reality is I highly doubt anybody heard of MauiKit, and frankly nobody cares. 

858 :  Are you an _official_ Microsoft or Xamarin representative, and if so, is this the official position of your company?. 

859 :  What do you expect, providing some real arguments against nonsense or offending replies like you're all mad" or "it's the others' fault, they need to rename" (aka "we are Microsoft (related), we are bigger, you need to comply" or, my favorite, "same name is not a problem at all", pretending that confusion was not an issue..." 

860 :  great strategy, being offending once you run out of arguments! 

861 :  How can you seriously accuse others of like, thinking in this old it's a big evil company" way (which nobody really has), while yourself being extremely off-putting towards the open-source community? It makes no sense..." 

862 :  How can you seriously accuse others of like, thinking in this old it's a big evil company" way (which nobody really has), while yourself being extremely off-putting towards the open-source community? It makes no sense..." 

863 :  You have *zero* reason to belittle this or _any_ other open-source project. 

864 :  Imagine trying to put up a faÃ§ade with mslinux, then turning stuff into a dick size competition with repo stars and other stats because you know you messed up and don't want to admit it lmfao 

865 :  you want to see what a real Open Source application framework looks like I suggest you start taking notes. 

866 :  It is unethical, you are don't have any arguments? 

867 :  I don't know how you can question the seriousness of one of the biggest communities that drive open source principles many years before Microsoft fell in love with open source. 

868 :  So a project has value based on open issues? 

869 :  There appear to be more passive-aggressive comments towards another project in this thread from you alone than there are from all other people towards this .NET repository. 

870 :  Unless you _actually_ work for the companies involved, your opinion is probably negligible here. 

871 :  I'm surprised no one complained about Microsoft's use of the name `core` 

872 :  What I do see is a bunch of people who want to complain but probably never have used Xamarin and probably never will use Maui regardless of what it's called. 

873 :  Beautiful! You steal name and say that it's OK! Good position! 

874 :  ... not sure if you expect us all to email you now, but please be prepared... 

875 :  Isn't that the exact opposite thing that any sane person would do? 

876 :  Its OK to be passionate but attacking another open source project for any reason is not okay. 

877 :  This is not the kind of community we want to have and such behavior will not be tolerated. 

878 :  Using sexual abusive language is not the way to express your opinion. 

879 :  Your assumption about that it's self-descriptiveness is only _partially_ correct when you refer to several ppl you mentioned. 

880 :  I myself try avoiding to assume that other people see and understand things exactly the same way as me, because every individual has their own unique experience. That said I encourage you to not make such assumptions here. 

881 :  You give false impression to others. 

882 :  Brian should argue his case from a position of hands on, mature knowledge rather than having us collect that for him and demanding his proposal be accepted unmodified and that none of us is in a better position than to test and evaluate the suitability of including the proposal of porting `canonicalize` unmodified into the go standard library for Windows than he himself and the company he works for. 

883 :  It's fairly frustrating to see my words being repeatedly 

884 :  You're incorrect 

885 :  I don't appreciate trying to have the last word on this argument after I told you I don't wish to debate it. 

886 :  Not only is your comment extremely insulting to the work my team is doing, you keep going and rambling we caAaAn't truUust theEem theEey're the deviIil in disguiIise"." 

887 :  I find this behavior ridiculous, entitled, and generally not up to the standard our community should strive for. 

888 :  Everyone who disagrees with me doesn't know what they are talking about"" 

889 :  Nice, the only notable contribution you've ever made anywhere on Github is making sure everyone at Google knows you're a racist. 

890 :  BlackLivesMatter is not meant to be a racist statement, except you see it like this. 

891 :  So you need fix it in you county, and do not force your problems to all world! 

892 :  Anyway this issue will be closed without an answer since Google doesn't care about people but sticking to their narrative. 

893 :  Everyone here will be called a white supremacist antiblack antiasian antilgtbteq1324 and risking to be banned from the repo. 

894 :  Welcome to 1984. 

895 :  Nothing more cringey than tech framework sites posting about politics, even if you agree with the sentiment. 

896 :  You know what, the white A" in the Angular logo is all of a sudden making me feel uncomfortable...maybe even a little oppressed. Hmm, could the Angular team be racists??? Maybe we should make a separate issue to change the color to black." 

897 :  Just noticed the #BlackLivesMatter banner on the home page for the first time...what a joke. 

898 :  Anyone have a list of other political movements endorsed by the Angular site? 

899 :  What's racist about it? Also don't shame others based on their skills and development experience. That's against the code of conduct. 

900 :  All lives matter" isn't racist either, yet apparently saying that makes you a white supremacist or something." 

901 :  People can express their opinions but the mods are just gonna lock it away cause y'all can't behave" and "the discussion is getting out of hand and is not productive anymore"" 

902 :  Funny how the first comment is being sarcastic about [the master branch] 

903 :  I guess I'll give up my Master's degree to show solidarity. 

904 :  why is it on the front-page of Angular and **what is the criteria** which determines what gets on the front page. **Who decides what's important enough?** 

905 :  If you're so sure that it's such a good idea, why do you have to act so quick about locking it so as not to give people a chance to give their opinion on the matter? 

906 :  But it just feels less and less a framework and more and more a political board. 

907 :  Why are you using this platform for displaying your political agenda. You have other platforms to do that. No one wants this here. 

908 :  This crap has gotten way out of control, give em an inch and they'll try to take a mile. 

909 :  Enough is enough already, rather than people getting offended by a word that is not offensive in this context, 

910 :  I can't believe the insanity that's going on. 

911 :  That's the context and the only context. 

912 :  I guess my `Masters Degree` now has to renamed to `Main Degree` as well.. 

913 :  Simply stupid. 

914 :  Stupid, like all this progressive shit destroying everything it touches. 

915 :  Simply stupid. There's no other way to put it. Stupid, like all this progressive shit destroying everything it touches. 

916 :  I recommend you finding another tool where you can work with easily without headache yourself with this particular one. This is what I did myself. 

917 :  You have missed some quotes around a string. 

918 :  I am a scikit-learn newbie and have just have spent a frustrating time going thought the docs, and I can't find anywhere how to read my own data (and not a prepared toy dataset), and what the python format of data is. 

919 :  I don't know whether you are one of scikit-learn staff or not, but I need to say that your way of talking is harming both scikit-learn staff and users (us) 

920 :  you seem quite misinformed about what is scikit-learn, how it works, and how the project is developed. 

921 :  it's literally your job. or you are here just to spam random stuff till people get pissed off and leave? 

922 :  your comments look absolutely random with quite zero connection to the reality. either a bot or ... very unintelligent person. which is fine by me as long as you keep a distance from me. 

923 :  so, if you don't know a solution, DO NOT POST ANY COMMENTS. 

924 :  and again  if you don't know a solution, DO NOT POST ANY COMMENTS. 

925 :  bot or something? your comments look absolutely random with quite zero connection to the reality. either a bot or ... very unintelligent person. which is fine by me as long as you keep a distance from me. 

926 :  There is no need for personal insults or caps. 

927 :  i dint yet started the insults. its called personal observation. look it up. 

928 :  what consoles and what modes? (did you actually read the ''To Reproduce'' ????? i have the feeling you didnt) 

929 :  now i have the feeling you didn't read anything at all. 

930 :  or you just assume that if it works for you work for absolutely everyone? 

931 :  you have not actually commented here regarding the problem or the intention to fix it. 

932 :  A bit of research can help you get the info you need in order to be able to perform the necessary tests to confirm/deny your theory so you can start acting on knowledge. 

933 :  Seeing this issue as well, its very annoying. 

934 :  Now: it seems like the discussion here _has_ reached its terminus, so there isnt value in leaving it unlocked for angry people to get their digs in. 

935 :  while I fully understand your reasoning, this is detrimental to people learning how to use Ansible. 

936 :  AT LEAST remove the banner for people that are not in the US. 

937 :  No, it got locked because people disagree with your ignorant stance. 

938 :  I will not participate in a dictatorship as you're too dumb on the matter to be my leader. 

939 :  You guys suck at everything! 

940 :  WTF Microsoft! 

941 :  Microsoft should grow turnips instead of writing software! 

942 :  I would be tempted to blame legalization for this kind of mishap, but you guys have always sucked at software! 

943 :  Windows sucks and now you even made .NET, your crown jewels, suck! 

944 :  This wasted several hours of my time trying to work through the suggested troubleshooting tips 

945 :  Can't you guys get anything done without turning it into a nightmare? 

946 :  Everything you guys put your hands on sucks! 

947 :  Relax and take your medication. 

948 :  So I guess I need to be smoking the same grass you're smoking in order to medicate my way out of seeing Microsoft's mediocrity?  No thanks! 

949 :  Because we can undo it" is not a good reason to present bad statistics." 

950 :  So as long as everyone reads through at least the first 39 pages of the Unicode standard then there shouldn't be any problem. 

951 :  Meanwhile, you've provided zero evidence to support your claim, which is based solely on your personal experience. 

952 :  It's no wonder that even Google's own engineers could care less about the company's style guides. 

953 :  And here I'd thought that Google workers were above mansplaining.  Stupid me 

954 :  It's a very convenient way of saying that the bug I had in my code was a bug with my design rather than the .Net Native compiler even though my code did/should work in any given .Net runtime context, but .Net Native is special, thus requiring special design considerations. 

955 :  before you close this issue you will have to adjust where you point the finger. 

956 :  The problem isn't with MessagePack, according to @MichalStrehovsky the problem is your design choice since you, being on the inside of Microsoft, have an even better understanding of the way the .Net Native compiler works. 

957 :  It may be a PITA to have .Net Native issues surfaced this way. 

958 :  Both the comment you make and the way initiated the closure of this issue was disingenuous. 

959 :  Just say so and stop pretending that any of the .Net Native compiler problems will actually be addressed. 

960 :  A year went by on the gRPC issue.  A year with no resolution!  I'd even be ok with a form of admission and a statement along the lines that we need to resolve these issues ourselves.   At least that way, time wouldn't be wasted on false expectations. 

961 :  ou're wasting a lot of our time slandering our competence 

962 :  You can censor me if you like. 

963 :  you keep bringing it back to advocating for breaking compatibility in the language design as if this was the same level of implication. 

964 :  I'm tired of this bikeshedding. I tried to advocate for keeping this issue focused on the actual bug that can be fixed (syntax highlighting) 

965 :  Seems more like Bram enjoys taking all the credit. 

966 :  It literally takes less than 30 minutes to learn git. That's no excuse. 

967 :  No, I don't understand.  Any software developer doing things exactly the same as 10 years ago is a **bad** software developer, let alone 30 years ago. 

968 :  To think that a new idea is better than an old one simply because it is new is foolish. 

969 :  When looking for information about Vim, the place to look is always the built-in help. Not Google, not the manpages, not the github metadata, just the help. In this case: :help credits 

970 :  So, instead of ranting here, maybe you should try to find the cause of the problem and/or open a PR that fixes this kind of issue, if necessary. 

971 :  This seems unnecessarily hostile, especially given that, in your own words, - I shouldn't complain about software I had nothing to pay for"" 

972 :  Have you considered simply reporting the issue, without any of the assholery? 

973 :  If you would like to re-open another GitHub issue calmly describing your problem with less vitriol and toxicity, I will gladly add it to my next release milestone, I'll add a test case for the situation, and I'll forget that this exchange happened. 

974 :  Sorry to say, that I am totally pissed off from this worst programmed piece of software/plugin I have ever seen. 

975 :  You actually need to keep hearing our feedback, every one of us. 

976 :  you should be working to find the screams because it takes tons of effort for us to get the screams close to you. 

977 :  you should want to know about all of these peoples feedback, especially when its them screaming in paper cut agony. 

978 :  So, let's put it straight, with the largest, boldest letters: **THIS IS NOT A FLUTTER ISSUE, There is no Flutter solution or workaround and never will be.** 

979 :  don't be stupid, it's a bug 

980 :  Your belief that you're doing anyone a favor by varying from the expected command line tool behavior, you should turn in your commit per.issions and get a job in management where you don't have access to break things AGAIN. 

981 :  By not doing what the command line tools do, you are varying from the expected behavior and breaking convention. THIS IS WRONG. 

982 :  Save your energy. Lex has rejected this again and again. 

983 :  Put your overlays as extra quads into your item model, he says. 

984 :  Threatening to coremods shit because you haven't spent 10 mins looking into other solutions is not the way to get things added to forge. 

985 :  It's pretty useless to complain about someone not looking without pointing them in the right direction. 

986 :  It's excruciatingly abrasive and dickish and impedes fostering a community that actually wants to contribute to a project. 

987 :  Going off on someone because you assume they haven't searched for other solutions makes you look like a dick. 

988 :  I don't care if you consider my response dickish, your initial post was. 

989 :  i'm sick of being threatened by people and coremods. 

990 :  I would have loved to work with you, but since you were not willing to accept any recommendations, I am closing this and we will do any remaining work in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/48058. 

991 :  WTF guys, you can't make built version of app? 

992 :  so to use it i need to download huge amounts of not needed data and applications? That not how the Linux works. 

993 :  And also polite mean to make installation for users, and not throwing in their faces some code and say do whatever you want with it"." 

994 :  t's really not that hard to understand... 

995 :  Why don't you develop your own terminal instead of asking like you are the CEO of Microsoft? 

996 :  Some people shouldn't act like a ass just because they think different. 

997 :  I agree that @creotiv should not act like an ass 

998 :  I didn't mean that but whatever floats your boat man. ƒ 

999 :  Where's your binaries?  Just because it's early and incomplete" (just like this code on this repo is) shouldn't be an excuse." 

1000 :  3 month to make an installer for an app)) that's nice) 

1001 :  Look, 24h later, a valid tiny patch is still not merged and we'd need to discuss" why shippable failed on its improvement, not even on the patch itself." 

1002 :  I can submit the bug elsewhere but do you really mean to suggest that I need to know about HPLIP and cups-filters to understand why three different tools process the options I've set (using your software) in three different ways? 

1003 :  Who takes responsibility when other projects don't know how to interface correctly with your software? 

1004 :  Are you ever grateful to receive bug reports about your project? 

1005 :  You don't think any of your documentation needs to be fixed? 

1006 :  So cups-pdf is HP's problem too? Is there any Linux software you can name that interfaces with CUPS correctly? 

1007 :  Is there any Linux software you can name that interfaces with CUPS correctly? 

1008 :  It would help to have an answer to this question, relating to the configuration of face-up printers 

1009 :  Please look at this, because @raver119 is still angry I said C wasn't a good language. 

1010 :  I don't even remember who you are. 

1011 :  That's a bit of surprising statement. 

1012 :  P.s. sorry. Just too many people around. 

1013 :  Keep it professional or I won't hesitate to ban you from interacting with this repository. 

1014 :  Just seems pointless to continue supporting something that uses so much developer time. 

1015 :  You can do that, but don't blame the software then. 

1016 :  You still try to push Salt to adhere to OMV data format, while common sense says it should be otherwise. 

1017 :  i alreeady said it was kneejerk impulse, so you eems to be crashing through door wide open. 

1018 :  You blaze of ego is called for. 

1019 :  Yesterday i spent hours looking into Salt code and patching it along your suggestions. 

1020 :  First i took your suggestions as correct and thought through. And just followed them. An then had to undo it all. 

1021 :  Now you imply it was your time wasted not mine. 

1022 :  you refused to help me doing it. 

1023 :  You made me look into Linux kernel i am not familiar with, at the same time you are not very willing to point me to specific OMV code and Salt commands you are familiar with. 

1024 :  you are funny :) 

1025 :  you can learn a bit about semantics, grammar and the meanings of words - essentialy about language and usage :)  can you tell me who was here offended ? 

1026 :  when we have storage OOM gradle doesn't sygnalize that, instead proper info we have a bullshit :) 

1027 :  still some daemon shit WTF ??? 

1028 :  Flutter team, PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE PROPERLY! 

1029 :  It looks like no one from Flutter team cares about the issue. 

1030 :  I'm sorry but I have to be this guy... The fact is that you left this repository unanswered for two plain month. 

1031 :  you MUST understant that without repo's activity people will not be interested in SUI anymore, and you'll try to find funds for a dead project... 

1032 :  I am BEGGING @levithomason, @jlukic, or any other project owner to PLEASE add at least two more trusted owners or managers with the power to add more committers and maintainers so badly needed. 

1033 :  A 10 second look would of shown you that. 

1034 :  do not readd links in which I have removed, do it again and you'll be blocked. 

1035 :  I have instructed you on two paths on how to achieve your goal now. 

1036 :  I don't appreciate you basically calling me an idiot in all caps when you didn't bother to even consider that maybe I had a good reason for doing it the way I did. 

1037 :  Except, you don't have a good reason, if you would of worked with anyone in the community to figure things out before resorting to hacking things with a coremod then we would be having a different conversation. 

1038 :  Fuck you flutter, if macos adds PATH, it just wont join, go to hell, youre so ugly, Google is so big, will the script be configured to die? 

1039 :  This is why Linux products are the way they are, and why no one had ever heard of KDE MAUI until now -- you lot just argue about inane stuff instead of getting work done. 

1040 :  Are you a lawyer? Maybe you should check with one before you potentially commit business libel. 

1041 :  Yes, I am opening a new one because fuck you Microsoft. 

1042 :  You are merely trying to cast a shadow on other, truly open source projects. 

1043 :  why did you close this? 

1044 :  The maintainers of the project are using a dependency that is buggy, they should take care of this 

1045 :  That's your responsibility to take care of things that don't work as expected in the dependencies of your project. 

1046 :  You are advertising syntax highlighting, you are supposed to deliver! 

1047 :  And if you don't, you are supposed to take care of whatever is needed to have your product work as expected 

1048 :  We're not contractually obligated to work on every bug and answer every question, seeing as we simply don't have enough resources. 

1049 :  (I) really love this ability to minimize comments on GitHub.. :sparkles: 

1050 :  You got us. It's a joke. 

1051 :  I mean cmon guys, is this a joke? 

1052 :  It is ridiculously funny not having a password lock for the most sensible information inside the phone that leads to basically unlocking all of your secure accounts. 

1053 :  I mean cmon guys, is this a joke? 2FA without a feature to lock the screen from people? 

1054 :  Your tone is derogatory. 

1055 :  This is the incorrect approach based upon your issue. 

1056 :  You got my support on this @filmgirl. 

1057 :  rooting for you @filmgirl ‰ 

1058 :  11/10, want to see this happen! ’œ 

1059 :  Knowing that this is possible my life will not be the same without it 

1060 :  I can't believe it hasn't already been implemented, this is a must have feature. 

1061 :  This needs a kickstarter campaign 

1062 :  How have I been using Terminal without this feature for so long? I'm using plain old terminal until we have it! 

1063 :  This explains a lot and why microsoft made ton of bad decisions recently, maybe the people at the top are delusional? 

1064 :  This is really offending for people that are suffering for global warming and desertfication areas. 

1065 :  Also is that a natural snow icon or a fake snow icon? 

1066 :  Please think about how much water Is wasted to create artificial snow just for games 

1067 :  It is really offending me because I am very snow sensitive and get hurt by snowflakes when it is snowing. 

1068 :  If I see that on the VS code I feel physically hurt. 

1069 :  On the other hand snowflake is the best symbol for spineless corporations bowing down to any random activist complain. 

1070 :  Also there was some recent effort to associate snowflake and Santa with its red hat to drug consumption so please don't talk about Its red hat and snow symbol in the same thread. :smile_cat: 

1071 :  I am with you guys- the one **TROLL** that offended many, many people got his wish fulfilled. Only ONE person wanted this ridiculous change and you are just ignoring so many requests to bring back what was deleted. Shame on you, shame. 

1072 :  You're not my dad, I can use everything I like / dislike! 

1073 :  Please stop offended me! You're not my dad, I can use everything I like / dislike! 

1074 :  I'd be really  grateful if that the correct reaction will be delivered like the other one, snowflakes do hurt and sting in the eyes, I won't be able to sleep if I see all day this hurtful symbol of pain and climate oppression in my IDE. 

1075 :  Some guy in Microsoft HQ is sweating right now.  Although this is 100% deserved. 

1076 :  His name is **Christian**, that must be a troll account, too good to be true :D 

1077 :  I'm from New Zealand, and in the Southern Hemisphere, it's not cold, but hot during the holiday season. I suggest you geo-locate the user's position and prompt them for the icon of their choice, e.g. snow, ice, fire, sun shine. 

1078 :  Every Christian should be renamed immediately to eliminate possible offence. 

1079 :  This is a serious discussion about the terror that is snow flakes and how it terrorises a lot of people everyday, even more now with the new VS Code update. 

1080 :  I would also like to point out that snow(flake) is _white_ and is commonly used as a white supremacy symbol to oppress and marginalize whole ethnicities, which due to systemic geographic discrimination couldn't historically experience, first-hand, full range of weather phenomena. 

1081 :  Winter is one good buff against invaders in Russia. Praise the winter! Let it snow! 

1082 :  The Snow Flake on vscode insiders and pushing it as a cozy"/"wintery" thing is very offensive to me." 

1083 :  This isn't just me either, think about the people who cannot even get snow, think about how you're making them feel, making them see what they cannot get, although personally I don't understand that. Snow is terrifying. 

1084 :  Oh no, I just mentioned way too many forbidden things, so this is getting removed too. Along with this thread. And me. And you. 

1085 :  We must remove the hat, all mentions of the hat, all mentions of removing the mentions of the hat and so on, just to be sure. 

1086 :  That's way too rational, a guy was extremely offended, please have some consideration! 

1087 :  The removing of the Santa hat and catering to vocal minority of sjw idiots is very offensive to me. 

1088 :  If Santa is a religious figure, then so is the Grinch, 

1089 :  It's so sad that people are so sensitive in the world we live in today that this sort of thing is even worth discussion.. 

1090 :  My understanding is that he was actually upset of the pagan origins :man_shrugging: 

1091 :  It was removed all because of this one guy: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/87268 and he prob think that what he did is funny. 

1092 :  Got as far as to feel the joy of my parents being alive, but then a snowflake got in the way and I got offended. 

1093 :  In addition, it reminds me of black people lurking around. 

1094 :  Microsoft scares me by forcing people to use this theme. 

1095 :  Please don't laugh. This is a serious issue for me. I want to force removal of the feature for everyone, because it hurts my feelings. And no, don't make a toggle for it. It would remind me that a death is still there, but not visible. 

1096 :  I don't know if it makes any difference, but I'm a black Jew living in Uganda. 

1097 :  To avoid being offended, please use the transparent perspicuous pellucid theme. 

1098 :  Did you just say trans-parent? But it's ok, my conservative belifs can and even should be offended. 

1099 :  PC?! What if I'm a mac-user?! 

1100 :  Dark theme is basically a blackface of white editors. 

1101 :  VS Code dark theme reminds me of this situation, so please remove it immediately, because for me dark theme = death. 

1102 :  User Christian-Schiffer that created such awful request offended many users and Microsoft just standing there like nothing happened. 

1103 :  I demand syntax highlighting be removed, as it reminds me of the other night when I puked out the three plates of ravioli I'd eaten. It is very offensive to me and instantly brings back memories of a very bad stomachache. 

1104 :  I find the V" in "VS Code" offensive. It represents two fingers being held up in an obscene gesture and could be read as "F*ck You"." 

1105 :  This censorship is literally a new holocaust! 

1106 :  I'm extremely offended by the fact that because of religious beliefs @Mikotochan 's only life pleasure has been taken away. 

1107 :  You deserve an award for skyrocketting the level of drama of this topic  – ! 

1108 :  One time a random person told me to œgit good and since then, œgit is extremely offensive to me. 

1109 :  Please remove Python compatibility I'm scared of snakes. 

1110 :  It's funny and sad at the same time that one selfish issue can cause loss of hundrets of man-days (people-days?) across globe. 

1111 :  I enjoy reading drama, please don't take my only pleasure in life away. 

1112 :  I think it is necessary to **remove** this Terminal" word, as it can really offend someone's feelings in some country at some time." 

1113 :  Additionally Terminal" has cost millions of Jews their lives over the centuries because the word "terminal" could also mean ["Extermination Camp"]" 

1114 :  Terminal" might also remind someone about a terminal illness they are facing" 

1115 :  Oh my god! Man! It's something that I wish for the years! Christmas miracle literally exists! 

1116 :  people who thumb down the santa have never received a present from him, naughty boys 

1117 :  it seems like kernel trauma, it has befriended santa and now microsoft crushed its dreams 

1118 :  Please add also an ultra-offensive debugger that shitstorms you on every error 

1119 :  I also can't focus on my work since then, please let me be productive again 

1120 :  Please make it your top priority to bring Santa hat back. 

1121 :  Coding productivity has decreased enormously since the removal of the Santa hat. 

1122 :  Assuming he wasn't just trolling: if one gets butthurt and triggered over an emoji or icon, then the internet is not really the place where one should hang around. 

1123 :  Pandering to icon haters seems to be high on Microsoft's list instead of handling actual bug fixes or feature requests. 

1124 :  Are you happy @Christian-Schiffer? Your behaviour offence a lot of people around the world. 

1125 :  I think you must apologize to these people and @egamma must do it too. 

1126 :  Get back the Santa icon you morons 

1127 :  How much of a brain do you have to delete that icon as a result of hate speech of a single idiot? 

1128 :  XDDDDD careful. microsoft now owns github too and they also take direct orders from jerusalem. your account will be vanished in no time. their petty feelings are way above yours so hush now 

1129 :  This Santa Hat situation is unacceptable. This is outrageous and humiliating. 

1130 :  We demand apologies from @microsoft and that the Hat be back! 

1131 :  Im just sickk of having to go through thousnads of tutorials, forums, chats, emails and so on every time Unity updates, or the HoloToolkit or the MRDL or visual studio... It is just SUPER UNSTABLE and a serious pain in the *** to do anything. 

1132 :  This is the first time I've heard from you, so **let's open a new issue and try to figure out what's going on**. 

1133 :  I am dead serious, WHEN??? You are not adding/doing anything useful to it, nothing beneficial for the end user. 

1134 :  This conversation is over. 

1135 :  why the hell did you haphazardly change the initial value of properties in this commit??? 

1136 :  why the hell you break my code programmed against gradle 4.10 in the **very first** release after that??? 

1137 :  i can't believe you guys, this is completely irresponsible. and don't tell me you needed to do this to support property conventions, you didn't. 

1138 :  again, I insist my way to fix this problem, which is no doubt the most simple and efficient approach to this problem. 

1139 :  I don't care about which PR will be merged finally, but I do care about the most reasonable solution for this problem. 

1140 :  This isn't how we have technical disagreements. No amount of technical correctness can make up for treating other people poorly, please don't repeat that behavior. 

1141 :  I don't know why you're so hysterical about which PR should be merged, and what I want to clarify here is that obviously I found this problem before you, and I have not even found the existence of golang/net@08b3837 until @fisherxu mentioned it in my PR, that why I push a new commit using http2.ConfigureTransports today and open this [PR](https://github.com/golang/net/pull/84) trying to fix the problem before. 

1142 :  And besides I didn't have any reference on your PR as I have not even noticed you before. 

1143 :  you should learn how to use Git with clear&clean commit history. 

1144 :  You have disagreement but no reason. That's personal. 

1145 :  You are so unbelievably arrogant that I don't want to waste my time arguing with you. 

1146 :  No amount of technical correctness can make up for treating other people poorly 

1147 :  that's not a good excuse for doing nothing, not everybody like you github employees (I heard most atom developers are ?) has a macbook for each, and there are many ones still using old computers, ... 

1148 :  You still haven't addressed my concern with this Issue, @crquan, namely that there isn't a method of determining if Atom is beyond the size of an editor should be"." 

1149 :  Is 207MB too big? Is 200MB? Is 10MB? Please give an example of what size is small enough" and what size "too big" and, most importantly, why." 

1150 :  A bug is nearly worthless if it cannot ever be fixed. And without a clearly defined goal, this bug cannot be fixed. 

1151 :  want to speak directly, the words very cheap to buy a USB" seems really ridiculous." 

1152 :  That make no sense, why you make efforts to a open source, because you love it. when you love it, why not keep it the best.

Please consider reading for more details on how we behave here. The next step if anyone wants to contribute code to address this issue would be to come up with a design for how to do build system integration such that we can have code generation work with Gradle, Xcode, hot reload, and integration with existing apps. If anyone is interested in working on this, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Otherwise I expect this is something we'll work on early next year. Once we have a mechanism to do that, solutions like DSX will be easy to integrate into the Flutter ecosystem. We may even find solutions that should be integrated by default. In the meantime we're also working on improvements to Dart's syntax to see if we can make UI expressions even easier to write. I would like to ask that people do not open new bugs on this topic unless there is something very constructive and new that is worth bringing up.","Ok this conversation has gone well beyond the kinds of discussions that we consider acceptable in the Flutter community, and so I'm going to lock this thread and close the bug. Please consider reading for more details on how we behave here. The next step if anyone wants to contribute code to address this issue would be to come up with a design for how to do build system integration such that we can have code generation work with Gradle, Xcode, hot reload, and integration with existing apps. If anyone is interested in working on this, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Otherwise I expect this is something we'll work on early next year. Once we have a mechanism to do that, solutions like DSX will be easy to integrate into the Flutter ecosystem. We may even find solutions that should be integrated by default. In the meantime we're also working on improvements to Dart's syntax to see if we can make UI expressions even easier to write. I would like to ask that people do not open new bugs on this topic unless there is something very constructive and new that is worth bringing up. Telling users that they can use DSX but can't use debugger or enjoy auto-complete is a non starter for me.",,1,1204,0.9375,1.0,0.05,0.2159383033419023,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

If Intel is truly committed to delivering high performance deep learning on their future discrete graphics hardware then they'll offer a single source option just like the others (AMD/HIP and Nvidia/CUDA) did before them ... PyTorch has no future. Envy much ? PyTorch is 10x more popular than PlaidML, newest techniques in DL are implemented easily on PyTorch, tons of different contributors and is actively developed by Facebook all the while Intel hasn't contributed to PlaidML in nearly a month ? What to maintain in plaidML ? Ops are auto differentiable, there is nothing to maintain. So I take it from you that PlaidML shouldn't receive any new fixes or new features in the future going forward ? If you don't see the value in improving code then there's no point in convincing you to acknowledge PlaidML's glaring flaws ... Machine learning is invented by professors of mathematics, isn't it? Doesn't mean we have to take up whatever programming language they make up especially in the case of Tile where elegance is clearly favoured over readability. It's no wonder why so many potential contributors are scared away from contributing ...

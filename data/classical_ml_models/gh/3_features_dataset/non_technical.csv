Obviously you didn't take my hint on length to heart but don't come to conclusions about my character because you don't know me at all.  That I appreciate and I read all your 'long writings', answering everything: no way, but when I answer properly you don't understand my answer and concludes that I am being dismissive.  It is obvious to me that you are not very experienced with JSX, you really don't understand how it works. So instead of doubling down just own it and I'll explain it in more detail. For example JSX & DSX only does the following 2 transforms (mentioned several times before):  Everything else is handled by the host language, so for example: how does it handle import of components named the same, answer: host language. I am not being dismissive, it is the way it is designed and the source of it's strength. You see if you separate markup and programming into separate files, you start to duplicate the programming inside the markup with simple constructs for 'if', etc. You end up building a declarative programming language inside the markup that can never be as powerful as the main programming language. So by bringing the markup into the programming language you have the best of both worlds and that's the power of JSX/DSX.  Notice above on (2) that the transform hardcoded <Widget and that's not always the case, so now you can specify that if needed as discussed before. Look at the transforms and now all symbols come from source or can be specified so there won't be some major magic gotchas in the future.  That's not true, you can have contrary opinion but you can't claim something true when I can proof otherwise. But that's the thing, I wanted the Flutter team to implement DSX but then I did it so what they need to implement is generic stuff that doesn't depend on DSX and DSX is not the only beneficiary. The browser js engine supports source maps which enabled an ecosystem of new languages in the browser that transpiled to js, it enabled the creation of Dart !!! and several others (Coffeescript, Typescript, Reason, etc). Dart could do the same now and benefit from the ecosystem that it helps bring up, all boats rise. I've already done it many times and the conclusion is that Plain Dart or DSX comes down to user preference, and the important thing is to provide option instead of forcing people one way.  I would use DSX because I prefer it, like spaces or tabs, type definition before or after the variable name. There is no point fighting for it, just accept that people have different preferences, there is more than 1 programming editor out there right?  Just your opinion, why do we use ""if"" statements in almost every language, 'for' statement, 'class', and now 'asyn/await'. Very good, now you gained my respect.  Thing is even if it gets closed again it won't stop people from asking for JSX-like capabilities.

The  tldr answer  is that  g file trash may not be supported. In order for  g file trash to succeed, the following conditions must be met:   * The file being moved to trash is on the same partition as your home folder    **OR**  * A trash folder already exists or can be created at the mount point and,  * The trash folder is considered 'safe/secure' by verifying UID and restrictive permissions   **How this should probably be fixed...**   Atom does not have a fallback mechanism like offering the ability to permanently remove a file instead. This would address bring atom in line with gnome's graceful behaviour. The attached image show how Gnome Files (aka Nautilus) prompt the user to permanently delete the file (when trash not supported)  **Impact: Users with multiple disks and partitions**   Fedora/Redhat/etc:  Impacted  due to default partition scheme that separates / and /home in to partitions. Files outside of the /home partition cannot be moved to trash.   Ubuntu: Less likely due to partition layout (/home is part of the / partition)   Conditions where users will be impacted:   * File systems with unix permissions:     *  Impacted with workaround  due to typical restrictive top-level directory permissions (root)  * FAT/non-unix file systems:     * User Session Mount:  No Impact     * Fstab:  Impacted  even with permissive umask. The default uid/gid is root. It will be unable to satisfy the requirements of a trash folder without additional options (uid/gid/umask).  * Network shared folders:  Unknown/Did not test.    **Notes/Testing the Root Cause**   Note: Though I am confident that my analysis is decent enough, much of the code I was referencing was unfamiliar/new to me.   Initially I encountered this issue when I put files in a certain location like the reporter above. I created a delete-me file test as suggested above in the relevant directory, /opt/cupenv. I ran the command strace gio trash delete-me.txt. A abridged version of the output is here  That's unexpected. The API documentation for g file trash lacks some level of specificity.  Sends file to the ""Trashcan"", if possible. This is similar to deleting it, but the user can recover it before emptying the trashcan. Not all file systems support trashing, so this call can return the G IO ERROR NOT SUPPORTED error.   One might assume (as I did): Given a path, if the user has permission to modify/delete the file, then GIO's g file trash API should succeed at removing the file in some manner. Perhaps, if trash functionality is not available, then there might be a fallback mechanism. In the case of gio trash I expected there to be a -f force option that would prioritize trash over permanently deleting the file. (gio trash -f only ignores files that don't exist)   Glib appears to implement GIO local file access using glocalfile.c. The trash algorithm looks like this:   * Is the path on the same partition as the user's home directory? If so, move the file to the home trash folder if possible and exit.  * Given the path, locate the mount point top level directory (denoted as topdir in source)     * In my case, the primary partition    * A more typical case  * If topdir is found, pick one of topdir/.Trash/UID or topdir/.Trash-UID folder.     * If topdir/.Trash-UID and topdir/.Trash/UID exists: Validate proper UID and file permission (or fail)    * Try to create folder topdir/.Trash-UID. Validate proper UID and file permission (or fail)   At the end of the function we find G IO ERROR NOT SUPPORTED is returned when such a folder is not found and cannot be created.  Files located on the same partition as your home directory can always be moved to your user trash folder. On my operating system, the paths / and /home are separate partitions. I created a file /home/tmp/x where tmp and x are owned by my user. In this case, the files get moved to your HOME/.local/share/Trash folder.    But when mounting disks (external or internal) using fstab or mount commands (as opposed to session-based mounting) issues can arise. I tested a FAT file system with umask=0000 and uid/gid set to root.    You can see gio trash going through the motions. The operations succeeds but the command still reports an error.  GLib/Gio will not write to a trash directory with incorrect permissions/ownership. (Security?) Without unix permissions, trash will always fail on these mount points. Modifying fstab to appear similar to options used during session mounts (UID/GID set to user vs root, umask is set appropriately). Conveniently the source code has a comment that seems to strongly imply this is a known/expected.    Most of this was unnecessary, but I figured I'd show my work.  ### EDIT2 #### More insight, to not get confused as of the nature of the bug, and how to reproduce it (by cutephoton as well):  Yes, as reported, the ELECTRON TRASH environment variable is needed. This is the issue referenced #15949 bug. The issue reported here is not related to #15949. The error message related to gvfs-trash is a blunt tool (even access denied errors produce the same error message) so I understand why people are responding here.   The reporter clarifies one of the key symptoms here  And that led to my deep dive. My deep dive details the specific cases where trash becomes unavailable (i.e. when a trash folder cannot be safely created).  **I just revalidated my findings and unsurprisingly gio trash still fails.**   Anyhow, I wanted to clarify this so it doesn't get lost when/if atom devs look in to this issue.","<!--  Have you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

I can even have several partitions with the same name on singe disk! Again, it can be fixed by detecting collisions and adding extra data, like counters or GUID or whatever, but... What gonna OMV do if OMV's user has two drives with partitions having same labels, and then he hotplugs one disk, or another, or both in any order? Is it race condition now?

Every single space-separated column of every single line. Ugly, and undocumented, but that is what it is. And, frankly, it is not that hard...  BUT, why do you want to compare with some arbitrary hex-escaped string? what can be a real use-case for that??? Linux kernel just does not have hex-escaping code for disk mounts.  Now, to be frank, even this would NOT be enough, because i can have multiple disks with the same partition label. Like many USB thumb drives with ""DATA"" partition. I can even have several partitions with the same name on singe disk!  Again, it can be fixed by detecting collisions and adding extra data, like counters or GUID or whatever, but...  What gonna OMV do if OMV's user has two drives with partitions having same labels, and then he hotplugs one disk, or another, or both in any order? Is it race condition now? Is it okay for OMV to have race condition? Seems whatever use cases Salt imagined for them here is very different from what OMV users might face.",not_technical,None,0,2621,1.0,0.034482758620689655,0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0

131,5319,383594627,"Hi everyone,  This issue overall is very complicated in that it is not easily reproducible and is very dependent on location, network health, and the actual download location of the target box. In many cases the box being downloaded is located on a third party system. One feature that was introduced in Vagrant a couple releases ago was the notification of redirect to show when boxes are being downloaded from a third party server.  There have also been claims that the embedded curl is downloading files slower than the system curl. I have not been successful in validating this claim and do not see a difference in download speed between my system curl and the embedded curl. However, as of Vagrant 2.0.4, the VAGRANT PREFER SYSTEM BINS environment variable is available for all platforms. When enabled, Vagrant will use local system binaries if available instead of the embedded binaries. If you observe faster download speeds with your local curl binary, this provides a switch to easily enable Vagrant to use the local binary.  My apologies for the frustration this issue has caused. It is something I have investigated multiple times, but the number of variables involved makes this extremely difficult to get a valid reproduction. I have updated Vagrant's functionality to make the underlying cause more easily understandable where available (redirect notifications) or easier to work around. I am continuing to investigate our options for box downloads from Vagrant Cloud in different regions of the world (which have occasionally presented with issues). However, with box downloads from third party locations, there is little I am able to do to control their available bandwidth or any kind of throttling they may impose.

Just be decent and follow the community's rules. Even worse, you don't seem to try to understand the other side point of view, and rush to your own conclusions.   [If] the consumer cannot base their actions reliability upon [semantic versioning], then what is the value of it even being exposed to the consumer? Very easy. Just imagine a version signature which has majors only, which would be equivalent to a standardless version signature (i.e., not semantic). You need to upgrade a library from version 234 503 to 244 503 because this last version gives compatibility to a set of target platforms you need to integrate. But you have no idea of the **intended** breaking changes by just looking at the signature. So you have to read the changelog from 234 503 to 244 503, have fun!  Quoting from the original specification: Without compliance to some sort of formal specification, version numbers are essentially useless for dependency management. By giving a name and clear definition to the above ideas, **it becomes easy to communicate your intentions to the users of your software**.  Semantic versioning is about **communicating**, nothing more. I am certain this is an area of improvements, and this is why semantic versioning is only at version 2.0.0 right now! To do so, we could explore different canonical unintended breaking changes between minors that happened in software history, where the interpretation of the contract was at stake. And from there, extrapolate a taxonomy of contracts and library purity.  What I mean by library purity is close to purity in functional programming: if you only expose functions with no side effects, the library is *pure*. If your library instantiates a singleton in the global namespace, it is *unpure*. If it rely on non-javascript, environment-specific binaries, it is *environment-coupled*. But I am sure we could go way further in describing what could be called the **library footprint**.  From that library footprint exposed to public knowledge, leveraging the impact of a library update would be easier.","@calidion It would be appreciable and civilized if you stopped calling the other's point of view &mdash, or the point of view you think they hold &mdash, ""stupid"". Just be decent and follow the community's rules. Even worse, you don't seem to try to understand the other side point of view, and rush to your own conclusions.  @DynConcepts  > [If] the consumer cannot base their actions reliability upon [semantic versioning], then what is the value of it even being exposed to the consumer?  Very easy. Just imagine a version signature which has majors only, which would be equivalent to a standardless version signature (i.e., not semantic).  You need to upgrade a library from version `234 503` to `244 503` because this last version gives compatibility to a set of target platforms you need to integrate.  But you have no idea of the **intended** breaking changes by just looking at the signature. So you have to read the changelog from `234 503` to `244 503`, have fun!  Quoting from the original specification:  > Without compliance to some sort of formal specification, version numbers are essentially useless for dependency management. By giving a name and clear definition to the above ideas, **it becomes easy to communicate your intentions to the users of your software**.  Semantic versioning is about **communicating**, nothing more.  > Yes, I agree it is about contracts, but this leads to the discussion of what exactly is a contract that provides the value necessary to truly be useful to the consumer.... In my experience there are multiple orders of magnitude between what is typically produced as a contract [by the publisher] and what is needed by the consumer to determine the impact on their usage.  I am certain this is an area of improvements, and this is why semantic versioning is only at [version 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) right now! To do so, we could explore different canonical unintended breaking changes between minors that happened in software history, where the interpretation of the contract was at stake. And from there, extrapolate a taxonomy of contracts and library purity.  What I mean by library purity is close to purity in functional programming: if you only expose functions with no side effects, the library is *pure*. If your library instantiates a singleton in the global namespace, it is *unpure*. If it rely on non-javascript, environment-specific binaries, it is *environment-coupled*. But I am sure we could go way further in describing what could be called the **library footprint**.

There are two main platforms that need to be supported. Modern Desktop PC (OpenGL ES 3, and later Vulkan) and mobile including medium and low end (OpenGL ES 2). These APIs are not programmed the same way, so a ""wrapper"" to simplify the work is impossible. GLES3/Vulkan uses UBOs, VAOs, TBOs. shaders with integers and plenty of features. GLES2 is very basic and supports none of that, so different approaches need to be used to write a back end.  Example of this actually exist in bgfx code base. Since bgfx is declarative API not imperative, you can actually write code that works optimally on two completely different APIs.   Modern hardware also uses certain rendering techniques (HDR/clustered/single pass shading),  while low end uses other techniques (LDR/multipass).

This is actually nonsensical statement. When you debug rendering issues in bgfx with for example RenderDoc, PIX, or GPA, you see underlying API and they are not getting confused with bgfx.

A stable and mature and professional product after all these years shouldnt. Thats the damn problem.  I mean... what kind of working product in IT receives ""hundreds"" of issues each day.... I once developed a C# utility library which was used for most of the tasks in the main programs of my company and so, used on customers machines. Given enough time to test it, It worked very well and the problems related to it were quite little and I had to put hands back into it like 8 times in 5 years for something that was trouble and not expanding it with new required functionalities. But it was used in companies with thousands of workers, in our company and in mostly all of our software.  The functionalities where broad and large since in C# you can do anything, it was about managing file i/o, mail sending receive, attachments management, network synchronicazion (RabbitMQ and other queue managers of IBM if I remember well), database CRUDS, serialization (xml, json), automation of tasks, orchestrating various windows services through network and more and more.  This has to do one thing: Web dev, yet it gets hundreds of issues each day, like web dev has changed much in the last years (and it's not, the only thing it changed is that anyone felt to be a great programmer and to excrete out a new js framework like it would be the new holy grail of web dev).

This is the actual code:  on the changing select element: `(change)=""onClienteChange($event)""`  ``` onClienteChange(e) { const customer= this.getCustomer( e.target.value.toString() ),``  ``this.orderForm.controls.paymentMethod.setValue( customer.paymentMethod ), } ```     So to follow up your discussion, I am already using the recommened method.  > > I'm fed up the whole framework is filled with this crap.

564,46430,46430,"This is a duplicate of the following issue.  I have temporarily forked Golang/Go and created this issue because the Golang overlords have stopped playing nice and they can no longer be trusted to host this conversation.  Regarding Go Issue, I propose again there is a third option: compromise.  On July 18, 2019, Github user stood up against the ""Go convention and language's designers arguments in the FAQ regarding the ternary conditional operator (""ternary operator""). The user stated specific examples where the ternary operator could improve readability. As of today, May 27, 2021 (the date the issue was locked as resolved and conversation limited), there were 105 thumbs up to this, and 107 thumbs against, with 5 frowny faces.  I personally suspect Google employees filled out the last of the 107 thumbs up and stopped after passing the 105 thumbs down, but that suspicion is admittedly groundless. (I'm sure I could investigate, it is accessible information, but I'm too lazy and just don't really care.)  Rather than hear reason or find compromise, the ""language's designers"" and their defenders (""the Golang overlords""/""the majority party"") planted themselves stubbornly against phrounz and the oncoming horde of software engineers forced into Golang projects by their corporate circumstances whose practical concern is just occasional convenience of the ternary operator in what is otherwise an ""I could take it or leave it"" programming language (""the minority party"").  Having seen 8 months of this debate upon my arrival to the issue on March 6, 2020, I offered a **compromise**, a **prediction**, and a **warning**. My words were met by defensiveness, ego, stubbornness, ignorance, and delusion.  The **compromise** I suggested was allowing the ternary operator to be enabled via configuration, even if it is off by default. That would have relieved the massive social tension that was building, and I believe it would have resolved the issue sufficiently for the minority party without totally sacrificing the values of the majority party, and thus manage to dispense the social energy without a social explosion. That is how a technology leader that understands people and how to resolve these kinds of issues masterfully handles these very delicate situations. The default of ""off"" is your win, which should be good enough for you. If you are truly right, it will remain off in the wild on average. If you are wrong, it will not remain off on average, because the world will decide you are wrong. I suspect, however, the world will just schism, and there will be about a fifty percent chance the option will be turned off no matter where you go (assuming the 105 thumbs up vs 107 thumbs down was legitimate and natural). These types of minor schisms happen all the time in software for precisely this reason, particularly in the realm of linting. You want that schism to occur out there in the wild, away from the language. Otherwise, the language will schism, and you will be forked, which was my **prediction**.  This brings me to the **warning**. I said, It is a mistake to think that a language should be the product of a small number of architects that know better without a deep connection to those that are actually using the language. I was surprised this was the only thing griesemer responded to, essentially saying he felt like I was wrong because the overlords talk amongst themselves and the majority party (my apologies if I'm mis-paraphrasing here). To which I would note that no, I mean really hearing all the signals coming in. By the time I arrived, the minority party was effectively muted. Starting a reply with the conversation is already over is not okay. You actually need to keep hearing our feedback, every one of us. We are that signal telling you something is wrong. Choosing to mute us rather than solve the underlying issue is like covering up screams with music, especially when the screams are not yours but you are the one causing the screams, and the one that can resolve the matter. In fact, you should be working to find the screams because it takes tons of effort for us to get the screams close to you. Most of the screams are so far away you've no hope of hearing them unless you really look. Try googling hate golang or golang ternary hate and really read the first forty or so results and really understand the loves and the frustrations and pain, and then realize that some of those people don't want to have to use your language but they are basically forced into it because of their jobs that switched to Golang from something else and they got a learn this or learn about your next employer ultimatum. (This wasn't me, btw. I learn new programming languages like other folks learn new songs. But I've read a lot of people's feedback about Golang while investigating this issue.)  So yes, you should want to know about all of these people's feedback, especially when it's them screaming in paper cut agony. Choosing not to hear it because you disagree with it is a bad choice. It lacks empathy. Not only is empathy moral, but it actually helps us constantly make the smart choice by keeping us on the same side as society. Ignoring the minority party is going to hurt the minority party in the short term, but in the long term, the overlords are going to end up looking like the bad guy, and that's going to hurt the overlords. **You can either choose to not hurt others because of empathy, or because you recognize that your lack of empathy will eventually lead others to conspire against you to your ruin, but either way, you should choose to not hurt others.** Which is actually a really nice way of restating my **warning**, even though it might look very different now that I have spent so many words describing it.  (And I feel like this warning applies so widely to Google vs Society in our modern times, may this serve as a warning from the microcosmic to the macrocosmic as well. Take heed, Google.)   Metaphorically, Golang is a lake built and run by Google, which is filled with paper-cut razors and signs welcoming us into the water. Enough people go that many others are swept along with them, and issue #33171 was serving as the complaint department where people would go to complain about the razors. And they continued to complain. And that took energy to deal with. And the overlords don't love their energy being sucked into this issue, particularly because they incorrectly see it as a non-issue.  So today, May 27, 2021, after vitalif joined the conversation and delivered the final straw by pointing out yet another case where the ternary operator improved readability, Golang closed the complaint department by closing and locking issue #33171 as resolved. It is not.  Intentionally repeating myself here: Ignoring the minority party is going to hurt the folks screaming in the short term, but in the long term, you're very much going to end up looking like the bad guy, and that's going to hurt you. And Golang. And I very much feel justified saying this is incompetence by the Golang overlords.  Here's why: There really is no right choice between the ternary conditional operator or not. If you google it or scour the scholarly databases of academia, there is certainly not statistically significant evidence suggesting a superior position within this schism. Hence, the reason for the existence of the schism. There's a whole lot of opinions, and they vary widely and deeply. It's like Vim vs Emacs all over again, except there really is no superior position here. (Vim is obviously superior, lol.)  What is evidence-based is the economics of the matter. The lack of a proper right or wrong naturally produces developers randomly on both sides of a schism (think statistical mechanics). That schism has existed since the ternary conditional operator was first introduced. But any languages (and most popular languages) now allow it, which is basically not taking a position in the matter. Those languages don't require it's use or disallow its alternatives. And individual projects can easily disallow its use if those in charge don't want it. So despite the way it looks, most popular languages are actually quite agnostic about the ternary conditional operator. Golang made a different choice, I suspect because of a combination of ignorance and ego. Upon its conception, Golang decided to take a position in the already existing schism (despite no real evidence of a superior side), thereby coupling the language to the schism. It is a foregone conclusion that either Golang will defeat/survive the schism, or the schism will rip it in half (schisming it). It's obvious to me that the overlords will lose here. They are up against at least anywhere near half of all their future users. They just don't have enough social power to win that fight. It's not clear to me that any organization of humans on earth is that powerful. Some kind of super dictator power might be sufficient, but software developers are practically wizards or lower deities in our modern society. I wouldn't bet against half of them in literally any fight, except maybe against the other half, but in this case I promise the other half does not care enough.  No, if Google does not change its position and improve its behavior, market forces (demand) will eventually win.  My prediction in March 2020 came from my knowledge of economics, not computer science -- but it's just easy to see the incredible forces of demand on the one side, and the quite impressive stubbornness of the Golang overlords on the other. It doesn't take much to know that something is going to buckle with fairly significant energy.  But there is always a spark that causes the cascade. I am now predicting that today's event was that spark. Of course there is a chance to save it and prevent the fork by allowing the conversation to continue in a more fair environment outside of the Golang overlords' control. Perhaps the overlords won't even show up, in which case I do predict the fork is inevitable. But, perhaps an accord can be reached. I'm hopeful.  Finally, I now predict that if a compromise is not reached between the parties, the language will be forked and the new language will be called De (pronounced Day).  This is a play on words, similar to how Go is the first two letters of Google, but because many people are increasingly looking at Google like a Demon or Devil, the letters would be De instead. So it doubles as a diss against Google for behaving the way it is behaving.","This is a duplicate of the following issue:  [https://github.com/dash-/go/issues/1](https://github.com/dash-/go/issues/1)  ---  I have temporarily forked Golang/Go and created this issue because the Golang overlords have stopped playing nice and they can no longer be trusted to host this conversation.  Regarding [Go Issue #33171](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/33171), I propose again there is a third option: compromise.  On July 18, 2019, Github user `phrounz` stood up against the ""Go convention and language's designers arguments” in the FAQ regarding the ternary conditional operator (""ternary operator""). The user stated specific examples where the ternary operator could improve readability. As of today, May 27, 2021 (the date the issue was locked as resolved and conversation limited), there were 105 thumbs up to this, and 107 thumbs against, with 5 frowny faces.  I personally suspect Google employees filled out the last of the 107 thumbs up and stopped after passing the 105 thumbs down, but that suspicion is admittedly groundless. (I'm sure I could investigate, it is accessible information, but I'm too lazy and just don't really care.)  Rather than hear reason or find compromise, the ""language's designers"" and their defenders (""the Golang overlords""/""the majority party"") planted themselves stubbornly against `phrounz` and the oncoming horde of software engineers forced into Golang projects by their corporate circumstances whose practical concern is just occasional convenience of the ternary operator in what is otherwise an ""I could take it or leave it"" programming language (""the minority party"").  Having seen 8 months of this debate upon my arrival to the issue on March 6, 2020, I offered a **compromise**, a **prediction**, and a **warning**. My words were met by defensiveness, ego, stubbornness, ignorance, and delusion.  The **compromise** I suggested was allowing the ternary operator to be enabled via configuration, even if it is off by default. That would have relieved the massive social tension that was building, and I believe it would have resolved the issue sufficiently for the minority party without totally sacrificing the values of the majority party, and thus manage to dispense the social energy without a social explosion. That is how a technology leader that understands people and how to resolve these kinds of issues masterfully handles these very delicate situations. The default of ""off"" is your win, which should be good enough for you. If you are truly right, it will remain off in the wild on average. If you are wrong, it will not remain off on average, because the world will decide you are wrong. I suspect, however, the world will just schism, and there will be about a fifty percent chance the option will be turned off no matter where you go (assuming the 105 thumbs up vs 107 thumbs down was legitimate and natural). These types of minor schisms happen all the time in software for precisely this reason, particularly in the realm of linting. You want that schism to occur out there in the wild, away from the language. Otherwise, the language will schism, and you will be forked, which was my **prediction**.  This brings me to the **warning**. I said, “It is a mistake to think that a language should be the product of a small number of architects that know better without a deep connection to those that are actually using the language.” I was surprised this was the only thing griesemer responded to, essentially saying he felt like I was wrong because the overlords talk amongst themselves and the majority party (my apologies if I’m mis-paraphrasing here). To which I would note that no, I mean really hearing all the signals coming in. By the time I arrived, the minority party was effectively muted. Starting a reply with “the conversation is already over” is not okay. You actually need to keep hearing our feedback, every one of us. We are that signal telling you something is wrong. Choosing to mute us rather than solve the underlying issue is like covering up screams with music, especially when the screams are not yours but you are the one causing the screams, and the one that can resolve the matter. In fact, you should be working to find the screams because it takes tons of effort for us to get the screams close to you. Most of the screams are so far away you’ve no hope of hearing them unless you really look. Try googling “hate golang” or “golang ternary hate” and really read the first forty or so results and really understand the loves and the frustrations and pain, and then realize that some of those people don’t want to have to use your language but they are basically forced into it because of their jobs that switched to Golang from something else and they got a “learn this or learn about your next employer” ultimatum. (This wasn’t me, btw. I learn new programming languages like other folks learn new songs. But I’ve read a lot of people’s feedback about Golang while investigating this issue.)  So yes, you should want to know about all of these people’s feedback, especially when it’s them screaming in paper cut agony. Choosing not to hear it because you disagree with it is a bad choice. It lacks empathy. Not only is empathy moral, but it actually helps us constantly make the smart choice by keeping us on the same side as society. Ignoring the minority party is going to hurt the minority party in the short term, but in the long term, the overlords are going to end up looking like the bad guy, and that’s going to hurt the overlords. **You can either choose to not hurt others because of empathy, or because you recognize that your lack of empathy will eventually lead others to conspire against you to your ruin, but either way, you should choose to not hurt others.** Which is actually a really nice way of restating my **warning**, even though it might look very different now that I have spent so many words describing it.  (And I feel like this warning applies so widely to Google vs Society in our modern times, may this serve as a warning from the microcosmic to the macrocosmic as well. Take heed, Google.)   Metaphorically, Golang is a lake built and run by Google, which is filled with paper-cut razors and signs welcoming us into the water. Enough people go that many others are swept along with them, and issue #33171 was serving as the complaint department where people would go to complain about the razors. And they continued to complain. And that took energy to deal with. And the overlords don’t love their energy being sucked into this issue, particularly because they incorrectly see it as a non-issue.  So today, May 27, 2021, after `vitalif` joined the conversation and delivered the final straw by pointing out yet another case where the ternary operator improved readability, Golang closed the complaint department by closing and locking issue #33171 as resolved. It is not.  Intentionally repeating myself here: Ignoring the minority party is going to hurt the folks screaming in the short term, but in the long term, you’re very much going to end up looking like the bad guy, and that’s going to hurt you. And Golang. And I very much feel justified saying this is incompetence by the Golang overlords.  Here’s why: There really is no right choice between the ternary conditional operator or not. If you google it or scour the scholarly databases of academia, there is certainly not statistically significant evidence suggesting a superior position within this schism. Hence, the reason for the existence of the schism. There’s a whole lot of opinions, and they vary widely and deeply. It’s like Vim vs Emacs all over again, except there really is no superior position here. (Vim is obviously superior, lol.)  What is evidence-based is the economics of the matter. The lack of a proper right or wrong naturally produces developers randomly on both sides of a schism (think statistical mechanics). That schism has existed since the ternary conditional operator was first introduced. But many languages (and most popular languages) now allow it, which is basically not taking a position in the matter. Those languages don’t require it’s use or disallow its alternatives. And individual projects can easily disallow its use if those in charge don’t want it. So despite the way it looks, most popular languages are actually quite agnostic about the ternary conditional operator. Golang made a different choice, I suspect because of a combination of ignorance and ego. Upon its conception, Golang decided to take a position in the already existing schism (despite no real evidence of a superior side), thereby coupling the language to the schism.

Sure, we could have deprecated the old console and parked the console subsystem and implemented a new PTY subsystem. That's a path we could have taken, but that would have left everyone with an existing console application asking ""why did Microsoft deprecate their entire console API with no plan to modernize those existing apps? Are they *fools*?""

I haven't personally debugged into this issue, but my gut agrees with Rich's analysis that the issue is coming from GDI. I certainly wouldn't call this a major perf regression, and I doubt it's due to any of our code in particular.

623,3117,3117,"Well, take it easy!!!  I don't know whether you are one of scikit-learn staff or not, but I need to say that your way of talking is harming both scikit-learn staff and users (us), due to the two reasons:  First reason, criticizing people (like what you did) and assuming that they are novice in Python so they don't know how to work with scikit-learn, means you or the staff are trying to blind their eyes to the truth that scikit-learn staff are not able to create a clear tutorial to allow loading the real data, at least. In addition, pretending that the tutorial of scikit-learn is perfect in spite all the questions regarding loading the real data (not the toy data as it is too easy to be imported comparing to the real data) is something needs to be reconsidered, and this means that scikit-learn staff don't care about the name of scikit-learn at all.  Second, we can understand from your unsuitable way of talking that you already forgot that  scikit-learn is a product, and we as users are customers, so either you or the staff of scikit-learn should respect all of us and thank us for any comment or bug fixing. This is the professional way of behavior. So I recommend you to think of your words before saying them. If you are knowing the way of loading the real data and you'd like to help, don't only say go see pandas, better you answer people's question nicely rather than hurting them with your words, but if you're simply not able to do that, so keep quite.  On the other hand, regarding the question ""should we instead add as a section in the tutorial here?"", I would like to say "" YES "", you or scikit-learn staff should add a section in the official tutorial about how to load your own data either CSV, or ARFF or text or whatever, as users are interested to load their own data, this is very critical issue should be considered in the tutorial (not to be ignored). *If you rely on the user, then what is your work? *  Nevertheless, for those who are still struggling with scikit-learn, I would like to say, this is not the end of the world, and as I mentioned previously, find another to tool make your life much easier. For this reason, and in order to save your time, I would like to recommend some tools to assist you in data mining procedures. For instance,  Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA), last version is  WEKA 3-7-13, is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. WEKA allows you to use its schemes either from GUI or writing Java code, so its very easy for non-programmers. Additional to WEKA, R is also an excellent tool for data mining stuff, you can also perform tasks of R from WEKA or vice versa. However, if you have a patience to design a prediction process manually (drag/drop), RapidMiner is a great tool for this propose where you can design a very nice flow to achieve your target.  Thanks David van Leeuwen for your support.","# Top level statements and functions  There are at least three somewhat conflicting scenarios around allowing statements and/or functions to be declared at the top level of program text.  First I'll consider each in turn, and point out how they conflict with each other. Then I'll propose an approach for C# to take.  ## Scenario 1: Simple programs  There's a certain amount of boilerplate surrounding even the simplest of programs, because of the need for an explicit `Main` method. This seems to get in the way of language learning and program clarity.  The simplest feature to address this would be to allow a sequence of *statements* to occur right before the *namespace_member_declaration*s of a *compilation_unit* (i.e. source file).  The semantics are that if such a sequence of *statements* is present, the following type declaration would be emitted:  ``` c# static class Program { static async Task Main(string[] args) { // statements } } ```  This would make it an error for multiple compilation units to have statements, because you'd get two classes with the same name `Program`. If the assembly is run, it would also be an error to have other valid entry points, such as explicit `Main` methods.  ## Scenario 2: Top-level functions  C# restricts named functions to being declared as members of types, as well as local functions. The closest you can get to a notion of ""global"" (or ""namespace-global"") functions is to put them as static members in a class `C` and then say `using static C,` in places where you want to use the functions directly without prefixing with a class name. This adds ceremony to both the declaring side and the consuming side dealing with the class `C`.  The simplest feature to address this is to add function declarations to *namespace-member_declaration*s - the kind of thing you can declare globally or in a namespace.  The functions would be limited in the modifiers that apply: They cannot be `abstract`, `virtual`, `override` or `sealed`. Their accessibility, like that of top-level classes would be `internal` or `public`, with `internal` being the default.  There's a design decision as to which kinds of function member declarations would be allowed: methods are key, but properties, indexers, etc. could also be considered. You could even consider stateful members (fields, auto-properties), and you would essentially get global variables. User defined operators and conversions are probably completely off the table, though, as they have relationships with their enclosing type, and there wouldn't be one.  On the consuming side, the top-level members would be direct members of the namespace, just as top level types are. If the namespace is `using`ed, or is the global namespace, the members are directly in scope.  The implementation would be that a partial class is generated to wrap the members as static members. The class name would probably be unspeakable, and would be chosen in such a way that the same name wouldn't be used twice in the same namespace across different assemblies. If any of the top-level members are public, the class would be public, and marked in such a way that a consuming assembly would know to expose the members directly.  ## Scenario 3: Scripting  There is currently a ""scripting dialect"" of C#, where top-level statements and functions are not only *allowed*, but are *the* way the program is specified. It's similar to scenario 1, except that the statements are freely scattered among type declarations. (Namespace declarations are currently not allowed in scripting, but that may change in the future.)  The execution of a script is often performed by a ""host"", that is able to put specific things into scope of the script, as well as access the state of its ""local"" variables. This is enabled by the state being represented as instance fields of a generated class, of which the running script is an instance.  Also, scripts can be executed as individual ""submissions"", one after the other, with subsequent ones being within the scope of their predecessors' declarations, modulo shadowing. In this mode submissions need to be captured as objects, and cannot allow stack-only things such as ref variables. Similarly, scripts are implicitly `async` so that `await` can be used freely, and this also limits the use of certain features.  If we want to add top level statements and functions to C#, we don't want them to conflict with how those work in scripting. Rather we want to compile them in the requisite manner when necessary, but unify on the semantics of the features. This doesn't fully eliminate the scripting dialect, as we would still need to deal with the special directives and ""magic commands"" that it requires, but at the minimum we do need to avoid the same syntax to not mean materially different things.  ## Problem  The main conflict between these three scenarios is in how top-level functions are construed. Are they ""local-to-the-main-program"" functions (as in 1 and 3), or are they top level library declarations just like types (as in 2)?  If the former, then top-level functions can only occur as part of a top-level program. They can see the local variables of that program, but they (and the local variables themselves) aren't visible to e.g. adjacent type declarations.  If the latter, then top-level functions can occur everywhere top-level type declarations can occur. They wouldn't be able to access the state of a top-level program, unless we also interpret the ""locals"" of such a program as top-level ""global"" variables. The functions - as well as such global variables if we choose to embrace them - would be members of their namespace, visible to any code in the assembly, and, if declared `public`, to any other assemblies referencing it.  # Proposal: Simple programs  You can squint and imagine a merged feature that serves all the scenarios. It would require a lot of design work, and some corners cut. I do not propose that. Instead I suggest that we fully embrace scenario 1, essentially fleshing out and slightly generalizing the feature sketched out for that scenario above.  The primary goal of the feature therefore is to allow C# programs without unnecessary boilerplate around them, for the sake of learners and the clarity of code. A secondary but important goal is to not introduce a fundamental conflict with scenarios 2 (which we may want to revisit in the future) and 3 (not having the meaning of top-level code differ between ""program"" and ""script"" scenarios).  It should be relatively straightforward to ensure that, while more restrictive than scenario 3, for programs that *are* allowed, the semantics will be approximately the same, enough so that the two don't materially conflict.  The approach more fundamentally clashes with scenario 2, and in its straightforward form it would bar us from extending the feature to embrace scenario 2 in the future. I propose that we build in additional restrictions to keep that design space open.  (If we later find that there's a need for libraries of top-level functions, we can also consider an equivalent to VB's *modules*, which still provide a named wrapper for static members (similar to a static class), but put the names of those members in scope implicitly when the enclosing namespace is `using`ed, instead of requiring an explicit `using static`).  ## Syntax  The only additional syntax is allowing a sequence of *statement*s in a compilation unit, just before the *namespace_member_declaration*s:  ``` antlr compilation_unit : extern_alias_directive* using_directive* global_attributes? statement* namespace_member_declaration* , ```  In all but one *compilation_unit* the *statement*s must all be local function declarations.  Example:  ``` c# // File 1 - any statements if (args.Length == 0 || !int.TryParse(args[0], out int n) || n < 0) return, Console.WriteLine(Fib(n).curr),  // File 2 - only local functions (int curr, int prev) Fib(int i) { if (i == 0) return (1, 0), var (curr, prev) = Fib(i - 1), return (curr + prev, curr), } ```  Note the use of `return` as a top-level statement. We may find that this looks/feels wrong since it's not visibly inside a body of a member.  ## Semantics  If any top-level statements are present in any compilation unit of the program, the meaning is as if they were combined in the block body of a `Main` method of a `Program` class in the global namespace, as follows:  ``` c# static class Program { static async Task Main(string[] args) { // File 1 statements // File 2 local functions // ... } } ```  If any one compilation unit has statements other than local function declarations, those statements occur first. The order of statement contributions (which would all be local functions) from other compilation units is undefined.  Warnings about missing `await` expressions are omitted.  Normally collision between multiple `Main` method entry points is only diagnosed if and when the program is run. However, we should consider forbidding any `Main` methods suitable as entry points to coexist with top-level statements. Or if we do allow them, we should not allow synchronous ones to silently take precedence over the async one generated from the top-level statements. That precedence was only reluctantly allowed over async `Main` methods for back compat reasons which do not apply here.  The example above would yield the following `Main` method declaration:  ``` c# static class Program { static async Task Main(string[] args) { // Statements from File 1 if (args.Length == 0 || !int.TryParse(args[0], out int n) || n < 0) return, Console.WriteLine(Fib(n).curr),  // Local functions from File 2 (int curr, int prev) Fib(int i) { if (i == 0) return (1, 0), var (curr, prev) = Fib(i - 1), return (curr + prev, curr), } } } ```  ## Scope of top-level parameters, local variables and local functions  Even though the `args` parameter and top-level local variables and functions are ""wrapped"" into the generated `Main` method, they should still be in scope throughout the program, as if they were declared with internal accessibility in the global namespace.  This could lead to name collisions, ambiguous lookups and shadowing of imported names. If one is picked by name look-up, it should lead to an error instead of being silently bypassed.  In this way we protect our future ability to better address scenario 2, and are able to give useful diagnostics to users who mistakenly believe them to be supported.

While a fun bit of trolling that I can appreciate, it's not appropriate here. And if, by chance, he was being sincere, then I apologize for my snideness, but my point still stands - that kind of comment is  still  not appropriate here. Did my disclaimer in my very first comment on this thread perhaps tip you off?  You equate me not having much experience with JSX and me not knowing how it works at all? While I've never worked on any serious React project, I've done my fair share of tinkering. I understand perfectly well how it  works . And that makes sense in the case where the markup language and the host language are distinct. With JSX, the markup language is designed as an  extension  of the host language. As such, JSX was designed as an extension of JS, and that's why it works as well as it does. DSX is an implementation of JSX for Dart.  You don't see the problem there? A markup language designed as an extension of one language being jerry-rigged into a foundationally different language. It is  inevitable  for there to be a load of issues, edge cases, and considerations. First, the whole idea behind separating markup and programming is that, if you are doing it correctly, there is a clear separation between the two which results in  no  duplication.  Secondly, if you are doing anything much more complex than ifs and fors in your UI code (which are constructs that can easily be handled in many markup solutions), then I would argue that it's a sign there is something wrong in your design anyway. As per MVC/MVVM design principles, if you are incorporating complex logic in your UI constructs, that's a potential sign of smelly code and you should seriously consider a redesign anyway.  (That's not to say that you  can't  write declarative UI in the MVVM fashion using JSX, but it's just something that invites trouble for little objective gain. Why use something in which you  can  write code that is standards-compliant when you can use something that makes it difficult to write code that  isn't ?) You haven't ""proved"" anything. You've given a bunch of subjective claims that have yet to be backed up with any substantiating logic. (Though to your credit, this latest post is a big improvement.)  You are still asking for them to do non-trivial stuff, so the onus is on you to convince them and the rest of us why they should and why it's so important that they should push down other things on their to-do list.  It is in the nature of JS itself that such a thing is easily doable (relatively speaking), so much so that Dart is far from the only language that has a transpiler to JS. As I have pointed out many times, Dart is not JS. It is static and strongly typed, meaning a lot of things that would be easy to do in JS are hugely complex in Dart.  By that logic, I should make a UI solution in which you define constructs using hex-encoded braille. I mean, if all that really matters is personal preference, all I need to say to defend its existence is that ""some people prefer it"", right?  You are developing a tool that you intend for other people to use, so you need reasoning beyond ""some people might like it"" to make yourself convincing. If you can't put it into words  why  they should use it over something else, then what makes you believe that they will? And what's there to incentivize you to  ensure  that they will when designing DSX's feature set?  First, those keywords (aside from async/await) became common programming lexicon because of the immense popularity of languages like C and BASIC over the course of several decades. As I've mentioned before, JSX is far from proven in its longevity - it's been around for 5 years and is yet to see any significant use outside of React despite the option being available.  Second, there's a big difference between familiarity and convention. if, while, for, struct, class, enum, try/catch/finally, async/await... those are all great ways to verbally represent a concept. There are reasons to defend using those keywords beyond them just being what people are familiar with - they make conceptual sense. (Of course, that doesn't mean that they are constants.

You apparently didn't pick up on the sarcasm inherent in his comment. (He literally did everything I said not to do.) While a fun bit of trolling that I can appreciate, it's not appropriate here. And if, by chance, he was being sincere, then I apologize for my snideness, but my point still stands - that kind of comment is _still_ not appropriate here.  > It is obvious to me that you are not very experienced with JSX...  Did my disclaimer in my very first comment on this thread perhaps tip you off?  > ...you really don't understand how it works.  You equate me not having much experience with JSX and me not knowing how it works at all? While I've never worked on any serious React project, I've done my fair share of tinkering. I understand perfectly well how it _works_.  > Everything else is handled by the host language, so for example: how does it handle import of components named the same, answer: host language.  And that makes sense in the case where the markup language and the host language are distinct. With JSX, the markup language is designed as an _extension_ of the host language. As such, JSX was designed as an extension of JS, and that's why it works as well as it does. DSX is an implementation of JSX for Dart.  You don't see the problem there? A markup language designed as an extension of one language being jerry-rigged into a foundationally different language. It is _inevitable_ for there to be a load of issues, edge cases, and considerations.  > You see if you separate markup and programming into separate files, you start to duplicate the programming inside the markup with simple constructs for 'if', etc. You end up building a declarative programming language inside the markup that can never be as powerful as the main programming language.  First, the whole idea behind separating markup and programming is that, if you are doing it correctly, there is a clear separation between the two which results in _no_ duplication.  Secondly, if you are doing anything much more complex than `if`s and `for`s in your UI code (which are constructs that can easily be handled in many markup solutions), then I would argue that it's a sign there is something wrong in your design anyway. As per MVC/MVVM design principles, if you are incorporating complex logic in your UI constructs, that's a potential sign of smelly code and you should seriously consider a redesign anyway.  (That's not to say that you _can't_ write declarative UI in the MVVM fashion using JSX, but it's just something that invites trouble for little objective gain. Why use something in which you _can_ write code that is standards-compliant when you can use something that makes it difficult to write code that _isn't_?)  > That's not true, you can have contrary opinion but you can't claim something true when I can proof otherwise.  You haven't ""proved"" anything. You've given a bunch of subjective claims that have yet to be backed up with any substantiating logic. (Though to your credit, this latest post is a big improvement.)  > But that's the thing, I wanted the Flutter team to implement DSX but then I did it so what they need to implement is generic stuff that doesn't depend on DSX and DSX is not the only beneficiary.  You are still asking for them to do non-trivial stuff, so the onus is on you to convince them and the rest of us why they should and why it's so important that they should push down other things on their to-do list.  > The browser js engine supports source maps which enabled an ecosystem of new languages in the browser that transpiled to js, it enabled the creation of Dart !!!  It is in the nature of JS itself that such a thing is easily doable (relatively speaking), so much so that Dart is far from the only language that has a transpiler to JS. As I have pointed out many times, Dart is not JS. It is static and strongly typed, meaning a lot of things that would be easy to do in JS are hugely complex in Dart.  > I would use DSX because I prefer it, like spaces or tabs, type definition before or after the variable name. There is no point fighting for it, just accept that people have different preferences, there is more than 1 programming editor out there right?  By that logic, I should make a UI solution in which you define constructs using hex-encoded braille. I mean, if all that really matters is personal preference, all I need to say to defend its existence is that ""some people prefer it"", right?  You are developing a tool that you intend for other people to use, so you need reasoning beyond ""some people might like it"" to make yourself convincing. If you can't put it into words _why_ they should use it over something else, then what makes you believe that they will? And what's there to incentivize you to _ensure_ that they will when designing DSX's feature set?  > Just your opinion, why do we use ""if"" statements in almost every language, 'for' statement, 'class', and now 'async/await'.  First, those keywords (aside from `async/await`) became common programming lexicon because of the immense popularity of languages like C and BASIC over the course of several decades. As I've mentioned before, JSX is far from proven in its longevity - it's been around for 5 years and is yet to see any significant use outside of React despite the option being available.  Second, there's a big difference between familiarity and convention. `if`, `while`, `for`, `struct`, `class`, `enum`, `try/catch/finally`, `async/await`... those are all great ways to verbally represent a concept. There are reasons to defend using those keywords beyond them just being what people are familiar with - they make conceptual sense. (Of course, that doesn't mean that they are constants. Some languages do `if ... then`. Some do `if ... elif` while others do `if ... else if` and still others do `if...endif`. Some do `foreach`, others do `from`. And so on, and so forth.)

Please consider yourself warned. Please read that code of conduct before submitting anything further to this or other Microsoft OSS repos.  By publishing and sharing StreamJsonRpc with the world, Microsoft hasn't committed to supporting it in every use case. Microsoft Support is something agreed upon between Microsoft and individual customers on a per-product basis. StreamJsonRpc is only officially supported in contexts where it ships with Microsoft products that are under support agreements. In other words, we are not obligated to make it work for you in .NET Native and have never made a promise that we would do so.  Just because Microsoft makes two technologies does not guarantee that those technologies can work together. And just because I work at Microsoft doesn't mean I have any deeper understanding of the .NET Native toolchain than you do. Microsoft is a big place and one team rarely has unique insights into what another team/product is doing.  Further, you have yet to share any evidence that this is a StreamJsonRpc flaw at all. MessagePack clearly has issues on .NET Native, but StreamJsonRpc's support for MessagePack *as an option* hardly means that we're responsible to make MessagePack (a 3rd party OSS library) work under every possible Microsoft runtime. I expect you can use StreamJsonRpc on UWP just fine in its default configuration, although I haven't tested that nor are we promising support for that.  Now if MessagePack proclaims support for .NET Native, and StreamJsonRpc *still* doesn't work on that platform, then re-opening an issue on this repo with the specific error you're seeing is welcome and subject to our limited capacity to offer free OSS support we may take a look at the problem and suggest how you can make it work or possibly offer a fix.  It's not just design choices -- there are simply features that .NET Native doesn't support. Some of these reasons I understand and some I don't. But this library does not nor I imagine ever will limit its feature set to what's available on the least capable of Microsoft platforms. For example we support dynamically generated client proxies, which is a great feature that I don't know if it can be used with .NET Native (even without MessagePack). Given dozens of applications and millions of users benefit from this feature, we wouldn't remove it or have suppressed its development just because it can't ever work on a platform that no one even asked for support for before now.  So as I stated before, I'm closing this issue because there's no reason to believe a fix is required in this repo.
